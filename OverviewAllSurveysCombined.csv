The current due date interferes with the on site book fair during conferences in September.  The inability to change the date to an earlier one is problematic.

I emailed to have paper copies of the flyers in time for the start of school, on September 6. For us, it is parent orientation and a great way to bring that warm fuzzy book club feeling to the parents! I am dismayed that the mailings are now done in a way that prohibits receiving them in time. I was asked to wait for my zone and district to be mailed out, and they expect that I will get them September 11 or so. Well if I send home the flyers at that time I will miss the October order window. We put work and thought we put into these parent orientations. They all remember sitting down and circling books when they received flyers in school... because we paint that picture for them. Yes, we encourage online ordering but seeing all the books ON PAPER and remembering the feeling is what gets these adults to order books. I am frustrated with the ""please wait for your sone"" answer. You see, the word we do is SELL YOUR MATERIALS. I can't do that if I can't present them. See previous box.

I had always thought Scholastic was an economical way to build a home library for kids, but it seems like you are getting more and more expensive. That's sad.  I won't be able to promote you as well as before to parents because things are more.  There's no dollar weekly deals and it seems your packs have gone up as well.  Last year I could get 10 for $10 and hope to see that come back.  As well as the $1 weekly book.  Or $1 deals in the flyers.  As well as the bonus points for teachers to go back to what they were before too.  That's what made it worth my time as a teacher.
