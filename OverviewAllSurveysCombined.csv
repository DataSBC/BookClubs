Their only access to books is through scholastics. Most that come have no credit cards, or bank accounts. THe only way they would get books was by paying me cash and then I would place the order and pay with a card. The new system is difficult, creates more work for teachers and there is a lack of consideration for  those of lower socio-economics. I have taught for close to 30 years and was a regular customer of Scholastics.  I am now reconsidering if I want to continue ordering book.",SFO,SFO,Narvar,

So, what I take from that is that my class order was auto-submitted, leaving my teacher order in the cart, which I now have to pay shipping if I wish to submit it?  How is this encouraging teachers to use Scholastic?  I don't make a lot of money, teaching in a private school, however I wish to bring books to my families, while also earning the bonus points to essentially get ""free"" books for my classroom.  If I'm being given no choice but to pay for my shipping unless I remember to submit my order manually in a very specific timeframe, how is that saving me money and why would I continue to use it.  Please, make this right and show your gratitude to teachers who basically help Scholastic to make their money by recommending you to our familie",Changes 23/24,Changes 23/24,OpinionLab Website Feedback,

No longer having the order form on the back for students to fill out makes it extremely difficult for teachers to receive student orders.  The families in some communities do not possess the resources to place online orders on their own so they send in whatever cash they can with their children to purchase books.  I am also no longer able to  quickly enter a students name and what item numbers they have ordered.  This is making ordering an extremely daunting task.

10/25/2023 13:13,2," Your clientele is predominantly teachers and families of students, and the teacher often takes the roll of communicating on behalf of families. When dealing with teachers we are TEACHING during the day and to participate in a chat and never get pulled away to a student is not always possible. I had to complete two chats and start over from scratch to get the problem resolved. The first one closed out of the chat without any warning because I had not responded for 7 minutes!!! The second one at least gave me a warning and thankfully the problem was resolved before they ended the chat. The first one though said they would handle it, then closed the chat, and had not handled the situation so I had to handle it AGAIN.  Overall, I am unhappy that teachers do not have a say whether to participate in the automated ordering and that even if there is an order in the cart it does not automatically go with the automated family order. I have students that cannot buy online, so they brought me cash and I placed the order for them. I have always handled my own family orders and placed them on the last day of each month. I was unaware of the automated order so the item in my cart was not placed with the auto order, and I am not going to pay shipping on this item when it should be free when included with the family orders. This new change makes sense in streamlining ordering however it is not equitable for all students/schools and there is not a work-around for teachers ordering on behalf of students. It either needs to automatically include the items in the teacher cart with the family orders or teachers need to be able to select this option or teachers need to be able to opt in/out of automatic orders.   I appreciate that the first person in the chat was willing to waive the shipping, but honestly, they were very impatient with their wait times to help. It is conference week, so I do not have time during the day until after 5:00 PM PST to deal with this other than during my lunch and it took so long to get the ball rolling that I had students coming in waiting for directions before I could finalize the support in the chat. I think based on the demographics of the clientele, representatives should not be held to strict time schedules for solving their issues and there should be a way for other representatives to access previous chats. Once I got the second representative, I had to begin the entire process and explanation all over again; again, while I am trying to teach and have students in class   In general, I am frustrated with these new changes and not very satisfied with how the chats are handled and timed out. Thank you for the work both reps did on waiving the shipping fee as a one-time courtesy.",Auto-Submit,Auto-Submit,CS Survey,
