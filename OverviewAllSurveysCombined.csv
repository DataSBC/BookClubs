So, while I understand the less paper products going out, I think it's wrong to put all the pressure on the teacher to be obligated to do all those extra steps in order to provide equality in ordering opportunity to each family. They should be still be given an option, or at the least, tax should be figured out on the flyer to make it easier on the teachers.

We understand the rise in prices, but it's very discouraging to see the loss of the coupon booklet and the drastic change in the September bonus point offering. We've counted on these items to be able to purchase GOOD books (not just the monthly dollar books) that are high interest for each student monthly. Now, this really won't be possible for us through your company any longer.

8/23/2023 9:22,1," I have been a teacher for 25 years.  I have always used Scholastic Book Clubs and for many years now, Scholastic Weekly Readers.  I am frustrated because it feels like it is getting harder and harder to get books at reasonable prices (meaning for less than you can get them elsewhere).  It is also getting harder and harder to use bonus points.  And...harder and harder to get free shipping.  There has been a significant decrease in the number of parents ordering over the past few years, despite sending home the flyers and encouraging families to order each month.  They tell me the prices aren't much better(if at all) than they can get elsewhere, so they don't bother.    Yesterday, I was looking for a book to give to my students when they meet me at Kindergarten Orientation.  I typically use bonus points earned from the previous year to place the order.  The less expensive book options in Book Clubs were not really appropriate for a Welcome to Kindergarten day.  I received an email from Scholastic, encouraging me to look at 25% off books.  That email directed me to the Teacher Store.  I immediately found a perfect book (Kindergarten, Here I Come).  I tried using bonus points, but it wasn't an option.  I reached out to Scholastic and found out that Bonus points can only be used in the Book Club.  So I went to the book club, but that particular book isn't available (something tells me that is deliberate).  Despite my frustration, I decided to return to the teacher store and just pay the price (without bonus points), but then when I tried to check out, there was a $9 shipping charge (I typically get free shipping over $25 - this was a $50 purchase, so I figured it would apply).  I reached out to Scholastic.  Apparently, I can only use free shipping in the Book Club (I can only assume that is deliberate as well).    I started looking around.  I decided to delete my order and order the books from Amazon instead!  The book was slightly more expensive there, but with Amazon's free shipping, it was basically the same (and guaranteed delivery next day, which Scholastic delivery time has been less reliable in recent years).  I am really sad to be moving further and further away from Scholastic.  I wish that a nearly 25-year relationship with Scholastic would be rewarding, but it truly isn't.  It is only rewarding under very strict terms that do not serve the purpose or desires of the customer (a HUGE change from years past).  I am very disappointed that Scholastic expects teachers to pay nearly $60 (book price, tax and shipping) to put ONE book in the hand of 16 students.  It makes me question my desire to continue my relationship with Scholastic.",High Prices,High Prices,CS Survey,

8/22/2023 17:02,2," Although it was no fault of the chat, I am very disappointed that the classroom order due date is now selected for us. I was told that the date is now determined by the state you teach in, and it is unchangeable. I also don't remember receiving prior notice of this, although I admit that I might not have read an update memo. Because the due date is so far away, I did not send out the flyer/notice yet that I normally would have. Additionally, when I printed out the parent letter to include in our classroom information packet, I was no longer able to find it in Spanish. Either I didn't know where to look, or that is a very culturally insensitive oversight on the part of Scholastic. Rather than eliminate the Spanish version, it seems as if you should be adding even more languages.",Due Date,Due Date,CS Survey,

8/22/2023 13:47,3,"Experience was fine, though I don't understand all the changes Scholastic as made the past few years. I find it difficult to have multiple bookclub websites. I used to be able to log in and it automatically showed me my shopping cart. Now I have to click on the shopping cart and log in to the teacher site (it takes me about 5 minutes to remember how to do this every time...especially after the summer break from school). From a teacher's perspective, Scholastic is in a much weaker place than they were prior to COVID. Rewards for teachers are way down. i.e. the first flyers were always the best as they offered substantial rewards up to $20 in free books and lots of bonus points. (usually was 10,000) This year's was limited to $10 and minimal points. I've also experienced a huge decline in number of students ordering. Prior to COVID I'd reach $300+ each 1st order of the school year. The last three years I've only reached around $50. I fear its that the catalogues are getting smaller and redundant. Variety in titles (and not simply recycling through the same books order after order) is almost nonexistent any more. Every book order is virtually the same. ",Other,Other,CS Survey,
