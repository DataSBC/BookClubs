11/6/2023,1,I am very disappointed in your decision to not allow schools to have choice in what they offer parents at their book fairs.  I will no longer be offering flyers to my students.

11/6/2023,2,I'm very disappointed that Scholastic no longer does dollar books. People donate money to my classroom and I would like to get each kid a book each month but it is now too expensive. Even the 2 dollar book is not appropriate for 2nd grade this month.,High Prices,Dollar Books,Website OpinionLab Survey,

I understand the need to raise book prices but the selection of books from the book clubs and at the fairs is far less than in previous years including just last year. At the recent bookfair at my granddaughter's school, there were many hardcover books offered but not purchased. In addition there were many fur covered journals and organizers that also did not sell.  There were very few books for kids who brought $5 or $10 to the fair. Parents are struggling to make ends meet and it is disappointing to send kids home without a book when they brought too little money. I am hoping this is a temporary change.

11/5/2023,2,"Ive been a loyal scholastic teacher over the last nine years.  I teach third grade and  have always had large orders from my classes.  This year, I have been struggling  and haven't had one order placed.  I send home the flyers and also promote it in my weekly newsletters.  The only change I have noticed is that the flyers have changed to 2nd/3rd grade combined.  Perhaps this is putting some third grade parents off that it is geared to second as well.  Any chance Scholastic might consider switching back to a 3rd grade flyer only.   Thank you!",Kits-Need,Miss Monthly Flyers,Website OpinionLab Survey,

When I contacted through chat, the agent told me to contact bookclub@scholastc.com which was not a direct link for feedback. I explained my opinion to them and did not offer to just go ahead and share the opinion with Scholastic themselves and share extra steps. I even asked for a survey specifically and they could have emailed this very link.

11/4/2023 5:13,4,"I feel like Scholastic is changing by not offering coupons or not as many  low priced books like they used too.  As an educator, and a member of Scholastics over the past 20+ years, I have used your company to provide books for my students individually or in my classroom library.  I have used the coupons as gifts for students  ($2 to purchase a $5 or less choice) .  This year I was informed that you don’t provide those coupons anymore.  Although I realize inflation is affecting everything, the rising cost really makes it more challenging for me to continue to provide as many books for students as I have in the past.  I usually always purchase “Charlotte’s Web” for each student as a gift after reading it as a class,  but for $5.99 each, I am saddened because I won’t be able yo afford that for 24 kids.  🥲  I do love your company and have appreciated the rewards from the points in book clubs!  It has also been helpful in adding to my library with the bonus points redemption!  I wouldn’t have such an extensive classroom library without it!    Thank you for all you do to encourage reading & helping  the community (teachers , like me) to getting books in hands of children! I have sure appreciated this company over the years as an educator!  The Book Club  have been wonderful in helping me to create students that love reading.  The “Branches” book that provide chapters from various books was a fantastic idea & I use it yearly as I introduce these series to my students!  It really helps to get them excited about reading chapter books!    Thank you for all you do to help encourage life-long learners & engaged readers!",Prices & Fees,High Prices,CS Survey,

I called on Tuesday and talked to the representative who asked for my card number and assured me that the payment was going to be processed. I used the live chat on Wednesday to confirm that the payment was done and one of the agents told me it was not possible to use a gift card after placing an order (even though I clicked on the gift card when placing the order). I called on Thursday, and the agent said I still had a pending balance because, for some reason, the order had been placed from my school account and they were the ones being billed (I asked the invoice to be in my name). I called again and the other agent stated that she could not help me because she does not know how the website works.   Saying that this has been a horrible experience is an understatement. The agents in the live chat and the representatives on the phone do not know how to direct your customers and apparently everyone has different information.
