9/26/2023 13:10,1, I teach in an inner city low income area. I contacted about ordering online versus through the teacher. The rep was very uncaring and just said that is the way it is basically and when I said I guess we just wont order this year they said ok thanks for contacting us. Good bye. Kind of disgusting as I have been ordering for over 20 years.,CS Experience,CS Experience,CS Survey,

I emailed with a concern on Monday, Sept. 18th 2023 and was quickly replied to a few minutes later with people very willing to help me solve my problem. However, I was told to reply with some information in order for them to help me set up my current account as a parent to a teacher account, which I did around 5:20 PM on Monday, and as of today (Sunday, Sept. 24th, 2023) I have still not heard anything back from them and my account has not been updated, but I have received two separate accounts asking for a survey response on how I felt my service was through their customer help desk. I'm not very pleased with the lack of communication and follow through on my actual problem that was supposed to help me set up a classroom book club that I now have waited over a week (we had the flyers sent home on Wednesday, Sept. 13th) to communicate with my parents about how to order their books through the book club. I was told Scholastic could help me set up my current parent account to a teacher account if I provided them with certain information, which I did, and no one followed up in an email and the account is not set up as a teacher account.",CS Experience,CS Experience,CS Survey,

Last year I was always looking for the order forms to pass out to inspire the kids to want to buy, but those are also going away.
