I used to be very proud of the books I could send home with my students.  Now the books that are available in that price range are tiny leftover books that were previously sold as a set- I know because I have some of those sets in my classroom and they were cheaper as the entire set, not just a small portion of the book sets as are being offered now.  I am also frustrated that you no longer offer Book of the Week or books for a dollar.

It was also nice for the teachers to buy these cheaper books in bulk and provide them to their students at no cost.   Second, extremely unhappy that you are no longer shipping to home addresses! I place large orders and I was previously getting them shipped to my home. The one time that the order was sent to the school, it was not all accounted for.

Also, I'm highly upset that your flyers don't include the tax priced on it.

Now I've been told that I would need to do the orders myself and then also include the tax on the books. These families already don't have the means to order online and now I'm also going to charge them more for the books. It doesn't seem fair. Also, you no longer have many of the technology items available in the bonus point catalog/shop. I appreciated having those things available to purchase with my bonus points. I've used Scholastic for many years and have always appreciated the affordable books and the ability to get free things with the bonus points. It would be helpful to allow communities like mine to be able to still order the way we used to. Thank you for your time.",SFO,SFO,Website Survey,

This really impacts the way I have used Scholastic book clubs over the years because the auto-date is the middle of October for me. Very frustrating. I already PLACED a September order and it still did not reset with a later date. Teachers should have full control over when all the orders are submitted and should not be dictated at by a system as to when they have to submit an order. I already tried the live chat and wasn't able to get a resolution. I am very displeased with the new system. After over 20 years as a loyal (Golden Apple) teacher, I am planning to stop sending home book orders due to this new experience.",Due Date,Due Date,Website Survey,

Book prices have gone way up (which we understand), and the rewards have gone way down (which is the part that I don't understand and am so disappointed in). I have used Scholastic for many years and have always been able to accrue enough points in September to get books for holiday gifts for all of our 75 students. Even with reaching and exceeding the highest level possible, we received very few points this September. It was extremely disappointing and makes me question if it is even worth it to continue using Scholastic. We are likely going to reach the highest level again this month, but the rewards/points still won't allow us to get all of the books we need, so we have to look elsewhere for gift ideas this year.

10/7/2023 17:09,2, I have been with scholastics for 27 years. The recent changes with regard to parents using a QR code to place orders are inconvenient and confusing for the  population in the area I work. Parents are unable to use the new way of ordering due to language barriers and difficulties navigating online. Our demographic does not have the tech skills. It was easier for them to use the order form and check off the items they wanted. I ordered over $200 of books for my students since their parents couldn’t use the QR code and ended up paying over $27 in taxes from my own pocket! That is unacceptable!!!!! I’ve never personally had to pay taxes on my student orders and I’m very upset over these charges. All the teachers on my campus are unhappy because they too had to pay taxes for their students. Not to mention the extra amount of time that will go into distributing the books since there is no way to attach student names to the items. It’s forcing extra work and time on teachers who already struggle with heavy workloads. I will not continue ordering if this system does not change. Scholastic has done teachers wrong with this update and will lose many teacher accounts if this new system continues. I hope management reconsiders these changes particularly for schools with large populations of newcomers and English Language Learners.

10/6/2023 16:22,1," The three biggest issues are: 1) You changed the choices in the rewards catalog to no longer include computers with no advance notice.  I have been saving my points for years to purchase a new computer and when I tried there are no longer computers.  Instead the catalog includes sand timers and silly putty as Technology choices.  I now have about 85,000 points  and a desktop computer in my classroom that is dying so I will have purchase a new one myself rather than collect the reward I had earned before you changed the catalog.  Had I known you were going to do this I would have placed my order last Spring instead of waiting until Fall  2) You processed my book order on your own before I was ready to do so. As a result, the order was placed before my in-class deadline. I could not input my bonus codes, I could not add the in class purchases. I could not add my bonus catalog choices.  and 3) The order came with no last names or last initials.  I ended up giving a book to the wrong student because he ""thought"" his mother placed an order, then he was slow to return the book to me which meant the student who actually placed the order ended up waiting an extra week to get his purchase. Another book I still have not figured out who gets it because all three of the girls by that name said they did not place the order.",Changes 23/24,Changes 23/25,CSAT Survey,

I couldn't find that option, but sent my info home to parents with a order deadline date of Oct. 3rd.  Your FAQ section states that Scholastic will auto submit 5 days after the stated deadline.  If Scholastic had done that, I would have had time to put in my teacher orders for Halloween with my class order but Scholastic submitted my order on the 3rd without any notice to me, as the teacher.  I usually get free shipping because I link my order to my class order.  This also uses less boxes, etc. by shipping items together.  Instead of helping the teacher, you have made it harder for me to use my points and order books for my classroom.   I request to be able to submit my own orders, or at least have the additional 5 days that is stated on your website, before you autosubmit my orders.  I used to love using Scholastic but you have made it very frustrating.",Auto-Submit,Auto-Submit,CSAT Survey,
10/11/2023 13:43,2," The problem I had was that I was told that the delivery of the package was my problem. I cannot be at school on a weekend, so I think it is important that Scholastic News give clear delivery information to their subcontractors who deliver the packages that the packages should NOT be delivered on weekends to schools. I don't think this is my problem to resolve. It ended up working out that the package was delivered, but I was not given any guarantee that I would not have to go find it at the post office. This does not make me inclined to help students with their book orders if it is just going to become a headache and a hassle for me. Scholastic News needs to take responsibility for a smoothly working system if they want teachers to support the book purchase program for students. There are many other ways students and teachers can buy books.","Fulfillment, Shipping, or Delivery",Delayed Shipping,CSAT Survey,

Her answer, in my opinion, came off as condescending. Like I should’ve known to do this. She just logged in and it was fine for her. No “sorry you’re having this issue”.

My student parents are not computer savvy and let alone if they have a bank account to purchase online. My students ordered books and brought in their cash. It was so difficult and time consuming to order the the books online for my students. Then come to find out there was taxes added which I did not tax my students and now I have to come out of pocket. I hav been a customer for about 25 years and I think your student order form worked  for my students and now it doesn’t.
