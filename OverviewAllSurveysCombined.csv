Most of the parents are not able to navigate this website, and will not take the time to learn. So, once again, the children are left behind.  I'm very sad about this.

9/12/2023 13:28,1," I spent several years saving up my bonus points to purchase an Apple technology product for my students to use in the classroom. I finally had enough bonus points saved this year to purchase it and suddenly all of the things I had been saving for were eliminated from the bonus catalog. There is now literally zero incentive for me to waste my time preparing catalogs and urging parents to buy books from scholastic when all of the rewards I actually wanted have been changed. Why was there no warning about this? A lot of my colleagues and I have been talking and we have collectively decided that it is no longer worth our time to help sell Scholastic books. Apple products had been a part of the catalog for the last ten years as I recall and were available as recently as June. What changed? In addition, the September bonus program was changed to only 5X the $ value of your class order instead of the 10,000 points offered as usual. If the goal was to make teachers less likely to spend their valuable time pushing your non-essential products to students and families, you have succeeded. I will not be wasting any more time this year distributing flyers, reminding parents about order deadlines, checking up on back ordered books, or doing any of the extra work required of myself to support your program. I'm not sure who was responsible for the decision but if I am writing to you about it, my guess is it is probably making a lot of other teachers around the country upset too as I don't usually take the time out of my day to complain.  If possible, I would like someone from your company to call me to discuss the reasoning behind this decision and/or possibly how I can go about exchanging my bonus points for actual money to buy one of the recently eliminated products I had been saving up years for.

9/11/2023 13:18,1," I have been a loyal customer of Scholastic for many years.  I am extremely disappointed by the changes made for this school year.  I have always been Scholastic's biggest cheerleader and have helped many teachers at my school find book sponsors for each of the kids in their class.  These sponsors donate money each year so students can receive a book to keep each month.  The joy on the kids faces when they get these books is second to none.  Unfortunately, due to your steep price increases we are no longer able to do this.  In the past you have always offered a wide variety of high quality literature often times at the $1 and $2 price points.  This year you only offer one book at a $2 price point and none at $1.  There are also very few books under $5 that are grade appropriate.  The $2 book each month is not always at an interest level of each grade level so this is not an option.  We as a school are so disappointed after trying to figure out how we can make the book sponsors donations work that we are considering partnering with organizations other than scholastic to make this happen.    I am also very disappointed that you got rid of the birthday book coupon option.  This is something many of us teachers have purchased for years and our kids look forward to choosing a book that they get for free.  I am assuming this was discontinued due to the lack of books under $5 as compared to the past.  Scholastic has fallen severely short of their goals of giving ALL students access to quality literature at a reasonable price.  The effect is that kids will not get to experience the love and joy of reading that they have in the past because the books are inaccessible to them.

9/10/2023 13:21,1," Scholastic has taken away the ability for teachers to set their own order due date, which is inevitably going to result in fewer orders. I've been using Scholastic for 22 years, so I'm not a fan of this and some  of the other recent changes. I ALWAYS get the most parent orders when I give families 1-2 weeks to order. If the due date is too far out, they forget about it. I also had to figure out myself that paper catalogs are only coming if I order them myself, so I didn't have them ready to send home with famlies the first week (which always results in the most orders). I'm also not excited about not being able to earn as many bonus points. And I cant even keep up with your website changes-- every year and it never seems to get better. Sorry! I want to love Scholastic, but you guys are not making this easier for this veteran teacher or incentivizing me to get families to order.

9/10/2023 9:26,1," For at least hte past twenty years of teaching, I have been purchasing the birthday coupon books from Scholastic.  The past several years, I have raised funds for my classroom to purchase enough coupon books so every student in my classroom can pick out a book of their own up to $5.00 every month of the school, plus a bonus book during their birthday month.  After raising over $400 to purchase coupon books to do this once again, I was told by the Scholastic helper via help/chat, that Scholastic no longer offered the birthday coupon books.   With inflation, I was counting on an increase in price for the coupon books, or perhaps every a reduction in the amount of coupons, maybe from 30 to 25.   Last year I believe the books were 30 coupons for $49.99.  I was shocked when I was told Scholastic no longer offered the coupon books.  Here I was ready to place my first September order of over $400 (PLUS an additional familiy/student September order would come later this month), and instead I am sending no orders home this month.  The Scholastic chat helper said that they increased the number of $2 and $3 books available for purchase for students, but that's not even close to the number of books a student can choose with a coupon good for up to $5.00.  And being able to choose their own book is a powerful thing for students, and that power of choice is what helps fuel their interest/love of reading.  In the current 2nd & 3rd grade back to school offerings, there are only three books $3 and under, while offerings for twelve books $5 and under.  I felt the chat helper was overstating the effort by Scholastic when touting their increased offerings of $2 and $3 books.     Another thing the chat helper mentioned was the Book Trust program, and how they felt that could be the solution to my dilemma.   What the chat helper was not aware of though, is that the window for applications to the Book Trust program for 2023 - 2024 has already closed.  I signed to be considered for the 2024 - 2025 program, even though I cna't sign up as an individual teacher, you sign up as a school, and the school is expected to contribute funds for the books, which I consider highly unlikey with current budgets.  So I felt the Scholastic chat helper really didn't fully understand how the Book Trust program works, but rather was looking at their cue sheet to say ""this"" when a disgruntled custonmer says ""that.""    So now I'm left with very limited options for how to spend the $400+ I raised for this school year.  I could pick out a $2 book for each student over the next 9 months, a book they may or may not like, or may or may not be at their reading level.  Or maybe I just have them pick out a book of their choice for one or two months out of the year.  Maybe just have student recommend books that could be purchased for our classorom library.   Neither of those options seems very enticing to me.  Not only do I now have to decide WHAT to do with the money I have raised, if the coupon books are not going to be offered int he future, I doubt I will have future fundraisers to purchase Scholastic books for my students.  So here I am, a Scholasti Gold Apple Teacher, who had a plan going into the school, that has now been scuttled, without any really appealing alternatives at the moment.  It saddens me that for the first time in over twenty years, September Scholastic book orders have not gone home to families, and for the first time in several years, my students won't be picking out free books this month.",Rewards & Promos,Rewards & Promos,Customer Service Survey,

It's a great way to begin the school year.  It is hard to find deals where the books are even $2.  As a reading specialist, I have sponsors that donate money so that my below average, reluctant and economically challenged students are able to receive a free book every month of the school year.  This promotes so much literacy in the homes.  I am also part of a reading organization Lewis and Clark Reading Council.  We do an annual service project called Books for Babies.  We buy books with a bookmark for new families with newborns and donate to either regional hospitals or pediatrician offices.  With the price increase and lack of value bundles, I may not be able to utilize Scholastic the way I have in the past.  Which means, I am going to need to search for a more economical solution.

Many of our families appreciate the $1 and $2 book options and will not be able to afford to order.

My students’ parents come from various backgrounds. Some don’t speak English, many are illiterate, most don’t have devices they can use or bank accounts/ credit cards. When I brought up my issue to customer service I was told that the change was made in order to make it easier for teachers and that I could order students books in my teacher account. Ok, so now instead of entering students orders and having their name entered onto the ordering platform where it was automatically saved and connected with the student order I will need to keep track of each order myself. How is that easier for me? I’m really disappointed in Scholastic for the elitist assumption that everyone has equal access. This was a thoughtless change.",SFO,SFO,Customer Service Survey,

Clearly, that is no longer the motto at Scholastic. I ordered multiple books throughout the year for my Kindergarten class. I will no longer be doing that.
