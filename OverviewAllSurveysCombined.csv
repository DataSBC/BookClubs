9/4/2023 9:04,1, You make things more difficult for families that do t have online access to place orders. Why in the world you not give an option for parents to pay with a check and send their order into the teacher like they have always been able to do? It’s discriminating and I will not participate. That and a “mandatory due date” are ridiculous. Anything to make things easier for your company with no regard for schools and families. 🙄,SFO,SFO,CS Survey,
