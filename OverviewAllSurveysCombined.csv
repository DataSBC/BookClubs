I believe options to parents on how to order books for their child is key to increase book orders.  Offer the option of parents filling out the book order on the book order form and teacher inputting order. 2.  Teacher orders of $25 + to receive the $10 to buy extra books for classroom should go back to the way it was.  Monthly!!!  Not this 4 week promotion cycle that does not make sense and teacher has to order by a deadline.  Make it, make sense!!! 3.  I was a gold apple teacher last year, this year not even close.   The book orders did not make sense and parents were looking for a page to mark their order.  First year, I didn't come close to the $300+ of book orders I get yearly.    4.  I say it every year,  your collection of Spanish literature needs to improve and provide a variety of choices.  Club Leo needs to be offered in a monthly book order, just like the English books.  5.  I love Scholastic!  I have been buying your books since I was in  Kindergarten at .25 cents for a Mercer Mayer book. (By the way, I still have those books).  You provided choices for kids like me who was raised by a single mother to feel like she had access to ordering books just like the other kids.

My disappointment is in the severe reduction of your online-only offerings for high school students. Just a few months ago, I would scroll for pages and pages to look at books. Now the list is ridiculously short, and I don't see any reason to continue working with Scholastic anymore if my demographic (10th-12th graders) are not going to be serviced anymore. You got rid of Teen book club, and now the online offerings are drastically limited. ",Variety or Product Description,Variety/Selection Offered,CS Survey,

Scholastic has made a required book order date that a teacher does not have the right to change.  This makes no sense.  It should be a choice for a teacher.  And for some weird reason you put the date at the middle of the month and we always make ours due near the end of the month, so now you are completing orders in the middle of our order separating up my points so I don't get as many as I usually would.

10/27/2023,1,"Very disappointed in the value of items that teachers can apply earned points for in the current catalog. In my 25 plus years of using Scholastic, I have never seen such a horrible selection of technology. Teachers used to get Apple computers for their classrooms. With budget cuts everywhere in our nation, the last place I thought would cut and short change teachers was the Scholastic company. This will be my last year with Scholastic if this doesn't change.",Rewards & Promos,Points Catalog,Website OpinionLab Survey,

10/27/2023,1,"HIDDEN INFORMATION! You have entirely changed the Scholastic Book Clubs system this year and HAVE NOT EFFECTIVELY communicated any of these changes with teachers. I am an avid email reader and will say you have started flooding my inbox with a lot of emails that are not informational so if you did send information about the COMPLETE CHANGE in how you are running clubs, I missed it while scanning your over abundance of emails. Finding this new set schedule (that doesn't allow for teacher individualization or solid family communication) is not easy. I miss the Desktop page where all the important links were laid out and easily findable (and adjustable to appropriate dates). I am incredibly disappointed in Scholastic for all these changes and lack of clear communication about any of them.",Changes 23/24,Changes 23/24,Website OpinionLab Survey,

Setting up book list and recommendations  is not easy to find.  As a teacher, time is very limited and I shouldn´t have to search back and forth or resort th the live chat to find things that could be more visible.  I´m also very disappointed that the Spanish book section is very small.  There are no Spanish parent letters and there is not quick way to customize my page to just Spanish books.
