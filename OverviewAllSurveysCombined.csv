I wanted information about YA LGBTQ+ books in the RIF catalogue. I was given an answer about LGBTQ+ books in general in the larger catalogue. Also the search engine algorithm you use for some reason things that dragons are LGBTQ+ related by default (dragons are cool, but a book with dragons is not always inherently queer) and also thinks that ""queen"" is an adequate replacement for the word ""queer."" There's also no option to search both YA and LGBTQ at the same time.",Product Selection,Product Selection,Customer Service Survey,

The customer service rep explained that this a change made to streamline the process for teachers, but I actually liked having the option to choose my own due date.  For example, I'd appreciate having my due date for my first order at the end of August rather than mid-September.  I realize I can still order earlier, but now I'll have to write my own letter for families rather than using the one provided by Scholastic.

8/3/2023 13:12,4,"My second question was not specifically answered, but I was able to infer an answer. My concern is that Scholastic is eliminating its Club Leo. Club Leo provided access to affordable books in the Spanish language and introduced world language and bilingual educator teachers and learners to authors and resources they may not otherwise know about. I have shared this unfortunate news with other language educators who are all equally saddened and disheartened by the news. Yes, your representative let me know that there are still Spanish-language books on the website, but this decreases accessibility, visibility, and even the variety of available Spanish-language books. Spanish is the second-most spoken language in the U.S. and the most commonly taught language other than English. I would request that Scholastic reconsider its decision as would many other language educators that I have now informed about this change.",Other,Other,Customer Service Survey,

These changes are making it harder and harder for teachers.  I am referring to no longer having 10 for 10 books, or the 6 packs of the same titles etc as well as changing our points store!

8/3/2023 0:00,1,Did not like the new layout of the website.  Also do not like that it looks like the differnt $1 books are gone and the 10 for $10 packs.  I loved these beccause I was able to buy books for my  studnets each month.  but at $2 a month I now will only be able to give them half the number of books.  Very disapointed.,Prices & Fees,Dollar Books,Website Survey,

8/6/2023 0:00,1,"I've always loved Scholastic and really appreciated the deals. I usually purchase the sets of multiple copies, but... I guess they don't exist anymore? I usually do a big push at the beginning of the year for my parents to buy books so that our class can get points. It looks like I won't be doing that this year. The prices are too high, the amount of points we earn are too low, and the point cost for book sets SO MUCH MORE than it was even just last year! I understand that the economy has been tough, but if this is the direction that Scholastic is going, I guess I won't be buying books for my class anymore. :(",Prices & Fees,High Prices,Website Survey,

8/6/2023 0:00,3,"This new switch in ordering has not been explained well.  Instead of just entering a class code, parents must now create accounts and search for the school and teacher.  On the front end, this seems much more complicated.  We do one order for our whole school, not individual teachers.    I gave it a test run.  Our school is listed twice.  There is a teacher option available even though she no longer works for us.  I do not know how to fix these things that may lead parents to order in the wrong place.  A sample letter to parents explaining all of these changes would have been nice.  Also, as the site administrator, clear explanations of all changes along with instructions would have been very helpful, rather than me wasting time in the preparation weeks for school starting, muddling through trying to figure it out.  I understand the need for deadlines, but having preset deadlines without considerations of important events on our school calendar seems like an obsticle.
