I've seen the books that are displayed in the catalogs decrease in quality. You no longer want to expose children to good literature. You want to make money so you are only producing less quality product and merchandise - more and more toys and video game books. This is so unfortunate. I found it difficult just to spend the $10 to get quality books from you into my classroom. September used to be the best month to purchase books due to the high number of bonus points you can earn along with a pack of free books. You have decreased the bonuses that teachers can earn through your club. For example, if you refer a teacher you now earn 350 points when it used to be 500. The quality books are in packs that are too expensive to purchase.

9/29/2023,2,"The changes to Scholastic are really disappointing.  Sending home book orders in September, earning loads of points, and using them to build my classroom library used to be something I looked forward to the most at the beginning of every school year.  By decreasing my teacher autonomy in how I use the website and raising prices on your books to the point where it is no longer in families' (or my) best interest to order from you as opposed to another source you have effectively ended my use of your program after this year.",SFO,SFO,Website Survey,

The book collections are smaller this year, and the new flyer designs are too oversimplified many of the books advertised on them do not include brief summaries anymore---a feature that I appreciated when making purchase decisions. An increase of toys and stationery on the curated flyers, which doesn't help to encourage my students to buy more books.     The ship-to-home option for teachers being taken away from the site is another disappointment. My school has faced several emergency shelter-in-places in the past, and because of that, it was more convenient to have books delivered to my home.     A lot of teacher perks, such as the $1 books after $100-purchases are gone, along with the multi-pack book bundles. The prices of books have risen sharply this year.

I honestly am not sure if I am going to continue to encourage my students to purchase books through Scholastic.  I have been with you since I began teaching in 1986 and I can't believe you are the same company. Scholastic is drastically different and not for the better. What happened?  I only had 5 out of my 18 students order books this month and the September book order has typically been the month where almost all my students place an order.  Over the past 5 years, I can barely  get anyone to order books. You have been dying a slow death since before the pandemic.  Sadly I don't see a bright future for Scholastic.

The same books and book sets are listed at different prices The search feature is more difficult to use and navigate.     I'm also unhappy with the catalog set up. I have been less active with Scholastic for the last couple of years because of shipping delays and other problems I encountered, but I was really hoping to jump back in to Scholastic this year. I will hand out catalogs, but I am not excited about how ""Book Clubs"" is starting out, and I probably won't be placing a teacher order. Most years I place a $300+ order in the first month, and at least $50 each month after that.

So have spent quite a lot of my money with scholastic.  So the new flyer format just doesn't have anything I can afford to do for 20 kids in a classroom.  Our school district doesn't allow for us to distribute the flyers due to not being able to charge tax. so my students do not have access to get the books unless I buy them myself.

At least with the $1 books I could buy them for my class in order to get books into the hands of my students. $2 books are almost nonexistent as well.  I probably won’t even do book orders this year because the system isn’t user friendly and scholastic is more concerned about turning a profit than getting books into the hands of kids.

My issue is not resolved at this current moment because Scholastic has not yet received 100 dollars worth of checks from my families.  So, apparently, they have been lost in the mail/lost at Scholastic and have not been processed at this time even though they were mailed more than 3 weeks ago.  However, your representative was very helpful in explaining the process to me.  I reached out to a parent who wrote one of the 4 missing checks and she said the check has not cleared through her bank so all 4 checks (totalling 100 dollars) has not made it into my Scholastic account at this time.

I do not like that parents have to place orders online. Some of my parents do not have access to Internet services. I like the process of me (the teacher) placing the order for some of those parents. First, a few years back, we had the additional cost of taxes being applied. Now everything is online for the parents. I am concerned that I will not have as many orders placed from my classroom. The school bookfair was a success and just maybe I can set something up for parents who have limited Internet access to come to school to place orders.",SFO,SFO,CS Survey,

I always submitted my parent orders accordingly in the past and was able to utilize the points earned along with free shipping to combine with my teacher order.  I was disappointed to see that I would have to pay shipping for my teacher order and was not able to use the bonus points and/or free rewards as part of the combination order.  I was advised to call.  Making phone calls is extremely difficult during the school day.  I hope Scholastic revisits this new process.
