8/29/2023 16:37,2,"My colleagues and I as well as another team of teachers that I’ve reached out to concerning this are very frustrated that there is no way to change the due date for book orders this year. This actually makes it MORE work for us and not less. I need to place the order earlier to be able to fit in each month and the parents won’t pay attention to the one place I put the actual due date but will go by your arbitrary due date. For instance, in December our preschool gets out way earlier than public schools for Winter Break. Students placing orders with your due date will not receive their books in time. Disappointed and so are all of my colleagues about taking this decision away from the teachers. I could see the following policy as a win-win: “you can set the due date earlier but if it’s not done by October 11th, orders will be automatically placed…” Please reconsider. Thank you!! We are all very disappointed that the due date for books this year is “fixed” and can’t be changed. This actually makes it more work for us. I need to place the order earlier to be able to fit in each month and the parents won’t pay attention to the one place I put the actual due date but will go by your arbitrary due date, especially if they won’t get the automatic 1 day left email reminder for the day I want it due but a week and a half later.  Also, you incentivize us to have “big” orders but if the orders will be split up, then we won’t get as many bonus points to help defray classroom book purchases. If we can pick the due date anytime before your due date and then any purchases that have not been submitted by your date, they can automatically be placed, this would be a win-win. Please consider this compromise.  Thank you!",Due Date,Due Date,CS Survey,

This transaction has cost me a LOT of time which every teacher knows there is never enough time at the beginning of the year.    Another thing, is I really loved a yoga ball I bought with my points on my last order and I went to order another one for my class and you no longer sell them.  That is super frustrating!

8/29/2023 0:00,2,I work with low income families in a school that is over 80% English Language Learners. This demographic does not typically have bank accounts and a way to shop online. The parents of these students do not speak or read English. These families rely on the teachers ordering their students the book. They give the cash to the students who then bring it to the teacher and enter it into the system. I now have to create and keep a list of what students bought what book. I feel that this is a serious disadvantage to the students who are already disadvantaged. I really hope scholastic seriously reconsiders the new way they are making families do it all online.
