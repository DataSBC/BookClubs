You must now collaborate with independent writers, embracing fresh perspectives and ideas. This is not a threat to tradition; instead, it's an invitation to innovate and adapt. We must recognize that today's children will soon inherit the world we leave behind. It's imperative we prepare them for the unexpected twists and turns that lie ahead, equipping them with the knowledge and adaptability they'll need. We should not fear change but embrace it. By accepting and adapting to changes sooner rather than later, we ensure a smoother transition for everyone involved. The fabric of our future is being woven today, and we must ensure our children are ready to uphold the balance in the ever-evolving landscape. Thank you for being a part of this journey.

When you enter the grade level, it would be beneficial if the latest flyer came up. It took me quite a while to find it, and I am technically savvy.

They started before our school year and so we were not prepared with our budgets to make the necessary changes in ordering our classroom sets.  We often receive donations to purchase classroom sets that we give to our students at the end of each month.  We were not prepared to meet the new Scholastic imposed deadlines.  Also, all the prices have gone up quite a bit.  Unfortunately, we understand this is a nation wide issue, but this year's donations we sought are not going to cover the new expenses.  Last year the books we purchased were around $2.00 a book.  This year we cannot find things for our Kindergarteners that are less than $4.00 a book.

The representative said that she couldn't change it and that yall did this to help teachers out. That is not the case. Not being in control of our own due date is frustrating. I didn't even get to send mine home at all and just trashed them because the due date was off for the parents and she said that they can place it whenever but wouldn't be send out until October something. How frustrating. They also asked if I just got my flyers in if that was why I didn't send them home yet. I informed them that I don't send home in the first few weeks of school because the start of school is expensive and hard on parents. I have been doing scholastic for 10+ plus years.
