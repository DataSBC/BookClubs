It took me a while to access that section before I could finally put in my second choice.    I think I shouldn't have pressed Confirm Order and just somehow put in the second one to total about $10.    It is rare for me to ever have a challenge in working w/Scholastic.  It is an outstanding organization.  This year I like the activities you have included i your order form like the word search and maze.

10/15/2023,4,"I have been a customer of Scholastic since I was in Kindergarten myself. Now teaching kindergarten, I love providing my students with Scholastic book flyers monthly to purchase books. However, this year will be a challenge to order due to the change Scholastic has implemented by having families only submit orders online. I work with English language learners whose families don't have credit cards. They are used to submitting cash for their orders. I have no problem submitting orders for families when they provide cash, but I don't wish to be penalized when I have 1 student buying 1 book, putting my teacher order below $25 and therefore charged shipping. If Scholastic no longer wishes to accept cash, I'm asking for Scholastic to eliminate the shipping fee for teacher orders, knowing that we are likely the ones covering costs for the sake of getting books in the hands of our students, where they should be. This is something I feel strongly about! Thank you for your consideration.",SFO,SFO,OpinionLab Website Survey,

10/14/2023,3,Last year I had the option to add the student's name when I added their item.  Please bring this option back because this is going to get so confusing when the box comes.  I am not sure if I will order again because I would have to write down the information elsewhere and teachers have a lot of paperwork already. That option would make it so much easier.    Also I preferred the SeeSaw flyer.  It was more organized and parents can see the level of each book.  Now the flyer only gives the title.  Please provide the levels of the book. It would make things so much easier because parents want to know the LEVEL of the book and I don't have access to the information when they ask me.,SFO,SFO,OpinionLab Website Survey,

10/13/2023,4,"Hi!    I'm a Spanish Teacher in Puerto Rico. I have loved Scholastic for a very long time now and my dream would be to work in your company one day. Every year, I access my account at the beginning of the year to see the flyers that are available for Spanish and Bilingual books. To my surprise this year there was no flyer, only some options of books (from previous years) I have been buying from you guys since you released a Spanish flyer every month. The parents at my school loved it because it gave them the opportunity for them to find high-quality Spanish books at an affordable price. I am very sad about this change. I believe that is of utmost importance for the company to offer more Spanish books. In this changing and evolving world, we can see the importance of having the amazing opportunity to learn a second or third language, and we all know that this begins at an early age. Please reconsider bringing back the monthly or quarterly flyer to Scholastic.    Respectfully,     A Span",Kits-Need,Leo,OpinionLab Website Survey,

We are trying, as teachers, to continue the love of reading for this age and Scholastic seems to not be vested in this.

You have a great deal of power as a brand and you could use that to advocate for children and to stand up for what is right and necessary. Instead, you’re choosing to forsake the well-being of children. Bowing to this kind of political strong-arming is reprehensible. An “opt in” for “diverse” titles is not good enough. In fact, it’s disgusting to segregate good, valuable books that can help so many children learn acceptance and unity. I will make sure I let every other parent and educator I encounter that they also should not spend another single cent with Scholastic until you reverse this policy. Legislation hasn’t even been passed! You’re doing this for “pending” bills? Shameful.

10/12/2023 21:20,2,"1. Stop creating due dates for teachers' online accounts. If you do create these due dates, allow teachers to change them to fit their classroom needs 2. STOP auto submitting orders. This is a huge inconvenience for teachers.  3. Bring back the teacher codes-PRVIE for example. Not all teachers are able to be found on your current system. 4. Bring back the old flyers. These are not conducive to shopping. I feel that I received a canned response to my concerns. I have spoken with multiple teachers in my large school district, and we are all dissatisfied with the changes Scholastic has made in the past year. Most of us have remained loyal to Scholastic through COVID when our orders were lost, or delayed by months. We were understanding and accepting when you shipped boxes to our schools that didn't have teacher names on them, which caused more work for all staff. I feel that we have been lied to by Scholastic. In the spring, a colleague called you after her parent online orders were auto-submitted.  We all hated that change, but she was assured that it would be a feature that teachers could opt out of this fall. After chatting online with a rep this weekend, I learned that is no longer the case. Today I received a box that contained one, teeny tiny backpack. The box was easily 10 times the size of the one item inside. It seems to me, and the teachers I have spoken with, that Scholastic is unilaterally making changes with no regard to teacher feedback. The response I got to my first complaint was clearly a canned response.   I will again state that Scholastic is not the draw to teachers, families, and children that it once was. Your prices used to be so affordable for families, it was easy for parents to purchase a book or two each month for $10 or less.  I understand that prices are up these days. However, when you have made so many changes that make my job as a Scholastic teacher harder, and I can offer my families options on Amazon that are more affordable, why would I not do so? My colleagues and I spent our lunch today brainstorming ways we can use Amazon and local retailers to get books in our students' hands instead of Scholastic.
