5/19/2023 7:50:00 AM,1," PO number 71553 was placed in Mid April and As of the May 15th we still had not received the order. I called and spoke with Abrianne Murphy and after research, she noticed that our order had been sitting in your warehouse for 2 weeks awaiting for us to set up transportation with DHL (which no one told us about nor have we ever had to do this)  I then requested that she just cancel the order because we do not have the time now to distribute the books to the students before school ends next week. Then all of the sudden, yesterday afternoon we received the order. We can not accept this order as we requested it to be cancelled and it has already been cancelled on our end. This is Federal money being used and we have certain guidelines to follow. Please make arrangements for this order to be picked up and returned.

I was told that I would need to place the order again and then wait for my first purchase to be credited back to me. I didn't think it was a big deal to change a delivery address, but apparently it can't be done. As a teacher, I can't afford to make multiple orders and wait for my money to possibly be refunded. I asked that the order be cancelled and am still awaiting my credit. I will likely end up spending twice as much and ordering the books from Amazon, as I have done in the past when Scholastic failed to deliver my books on time.

I called & sent a message right away in the morning after the submission hoping to have the submission reversed so I could keep it open for 4 more days when my due date ended.  It was not possible.  At least from the info received from the customer service representative I will be allowed to add on any other orders to the one placed so I can receive my teacher deals.

I understand that an email was sent in regards to the matter, however, due to other circumstances, I was unable to stop the auto-ordering and now have lost out on my part of the order using my points and not having to pay shipping and the free books that I would have earned because of my student's orders.

I still have student flyer orders being sent in, and scholastic already submitted my online orders, not allowing me to wait until all my orders are in so I could receive the promotions, etc. As I was talking to the man on the phone, he completely talked over me and ignored me. It was completely unprofessional, and if there is not an option to opt out of the automatic submissions I will not be ordering again.",Unhappy Auto-Submit,Unhappy Auto-Submit,CS Experience Survey,463521501036

5/1/2023 3:10:00 PM,2," I am saddened that you have made the most affordable books not applicable for using teacher bonus points.  I always use my accumulated points to buy each of my students a book as an end of the year gift, and this year, I cannot do that due to this change.  I cannot afford to spend $50 to buy each of my students a book, so I will not use scholastic in this way anymore.  I would have hoped you would be more understanding of teachers' needs.","Prices, Fees, or Rewards Issue","Prices, Fees, or Rewards Issue",CS Experience Survey,463598627364

I do not know what the big hurry was to submit it so quick. But you missed out on the purchase of more books and I missed out on the $10 bonus money in books.

5/1/2023 1:16:00 PM,2," I received an email stating that my online student orders had been auto-submitted. I only just sent home the fliers late last week and they are not due until May 4th. The auto-submit that happened is frustrating, as I planned to add to the order myself, I get points for the total order submitted, I have a coupon code for points, and I wanted to spend points with this last order of the school year. Now, I have lost the opportunity to increase my points based on order dollar amount, as well as the above stated issues. The representative I chatted with briefly just said this was to make it easier for teachers and I could call or email someone once the other family orders are in and I submit them, but this does not make it easier for me. I now will have take time to call, as well as have multiple shipments to track and hand out. I would recommend not auto-submitting in the future.",Unhappy Auto-Submit,Unhappy Auto-Submit,CS Experience Survey,463598687542

Two differnt (very nice) customer serivce reps tried to help but were unable to provide a simple solution to the problem..  If you are going to give a gift card then using it on your website should not be difficult.  Maybe you could just award people $50 credit on their Scholatic account.  Yes, I realize peope might like to use it somewhere else but at this point I am almost afraid to try it.",Other,Other,CS Experience Survey,463442729132
