Then I either have to pay it (on top of the other many things I pay for my classroom) or I have to send the book orders back and tell them I can't order if it's just one student.  I understand shipping isn't cheap, but can those low orders just be piggy-backed onto another order that goes out to that same location (if possible)?  I'm not sure what the answer is.

I realize the prize materials and misc. need to be in a box, but in the future, if a book cannot fit in a case I do not want them shipped.  We don't have time or physical ability to be dealing with all these boxes.  Years ago we had help from our Scholastic Reps and they set up our fair for us.

Teachers also need an option to enter individual student orders to accommodate families that do not have internet access - this is an equity issue.  The ""glow-up"" makes Book Clubs less accessible to students and more difficult for teachers to implement.  Also - the recent media stories about Scholastic not advocating for access to diverse books is in direct opposition to the educational mission of public school systems across the country.

It is the $$ and the lack of being able to enter student's orders in as student orders, parents having to enter orders online, which isn't making it accessible to all. The lack of affordable books for students is sad and the hoops you make teachers jump through to ""unlock"" the $1 books is unprofessional. Students in my class will never reach the $100 an order to unlock squat. I'll most likely be taking my business elsewhere. I created a program to get donations from friends and family to be able to get books in the hands of all of my  kids-EACH month of the school year. Due to tax, increased prices, I won't be able to cover that for my students despite my friends and family donating enough for me to cover all my students for the school year. I've been getting scholastic stuff since I was a kid (1978ish).

I love them so I can get consumable items for my students related to our curriculum. I buy & love earning free books & my library is extremely full as a veteran teacher. I buy books for my students and love the fun items for class store and raffle prizes for achievement and behavior.  I promote heavily with my students and families.  One of my joys was to earn a gift card. It was one of my motivations besides literacy. I've always spent a lot of money on my classroom and students.  I've always worked at lower-socioeconomic schools, so many families can't always buy books but I check them out for home reading.  I use my book order books for thematic teaching, centers, reading group books, and I put them out on my white board tray for free choice reading when students get done with work and right after they come in from lunch recess. I was saving up for a gift card since last year, so I was highly disappointed.  I buy like to buy things like Oreos (which are very expensive) for our OREO writing in 2nd grade. O-opinion statement opening R- reasons E- explain & O restate opinion as a closing. The customer service chat rep was extremely pleasant and professional, so I did appreciate that.

I had sent the beginning of the year flyers, so families did not get a chance to view the paper October flyers.   Secondly, I still have not heard from any member of Scholastic about the concerns I raised back in early September about not offering the coupon books good for books up to $5.00.  With them, I was able to provided a free book for every student in my class for every month of the school year.  I've been doing this for a number of years.  Right now, the money I raised through my classroom campaign just sits in my account, about $400.   At this moment I have NO PLANS to raise funds for a class campaign next year with the book coupons.  I talked to multiple customer reps through the help chat and no one from administration ever followed up with my concerns.  The chat person shared information about a book program that can help provide free books for students, but failed to mention that the deadline for the 23-24 program had already passed.  The program is also for schools, and not individual classrooms, something the chat helper didn't seem to be aware of.    I don't know what happened at the leadership of Scholastic to prompt the changes above, but it would have been nice for someone from Scholastic to contact this (former) Gold Apple Teacher about their concerns....it's been over one month.",,Responding to my previous comments would be a first step in making my customer experience better.,No,Yes,No,YTO,YTO,,https://scholasticnso.satmetrix.com/app/core/main/home.jsp#actions/1697563720183_16801,10/16/2023 0:00

The 10,000 bonus points for a $300 order was huge for my classroom to keep books replaced when overly loved and to provide different reading varieties to different groups of students each year. I used nearly 20,000 points on my first order to update my library and earned less than 5,000 points in return.  At that rate, I’ll only be able to do updates every 4 years.  I also share books with new teachers at the BOY and send every child home with 1-2 books for Christmas.  These perks won’t be doable with the new point system.    In addition, I do not like that the website automatically submits orders and I am unable to change the dates.  I set a schedule that works for my families and classrooms, and I don’t like Scholastic submitting orders in the middle of my due dates because students receive their books at different times.    I have LOVED Scholastic since I was a child, and I continue to get excited as an adult to send those flyers home…especially when they start circling their favorites and talking with their classmates about their choices!  However, the new flyers were not nearly as exciting this year.  Instead of multiple flyers with hundreds of books, it was a 1 page flyer with far less choice.  I know that online has several choices and most all orders are submitted online, but it takes away a lot of that magical discussion about books and the love for reading.  I do admit sending 6+ flyers home around Christmas was a lot, but there should be a happy medium.  Scholastic has always been great in helping teachers get not only books but other supplies for classrooms for decades.  I feel like these new “updates” are another stab at teachers who are already lacking in everything and supplementing with their own very meager paycheck.  I’m disappointed and I hope that some of these “updates” will be reevaluated.",,"The support system for Scholastic is top notch!  I love the chat option and phone option.  I’ve had very few errors in my orders over my many years of teaching and using Scholastic, but the support system has always gone above and beyond in helping or answering questions.
