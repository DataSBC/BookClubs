I had sent the beginning of the year flyers, so families did not get a chance to view the paper October flyers.   Secondly, I still have not heard from any member of Scholastic about the concerns I raised back in early September about not offering the coupon books good for books up to $5.00.  With them, I was able to provided a free book for every student in my class for every month of the school year.  I've been doing this for a number of years.  Right now, the money I raised through my classroom campaign just sits in my account, about $400.   At this moment I have NO PLANS to raise funds for a class campaign next year with the book coupons.  I talked to multiple customer reps through the help chat and no one from administration ever followed up with my concerns.  The chat person shared information about a book program that can help provide free books for students, but failed to mention that the deadline for the 23-24 program had already passed.  The program is also for schools, and not individual classrooms, something the chat helper didn't seem to be aware of.    I don't know what happened at the leadership of Scholastic to prompt the changes above, but it would have been nice for someone from Scholastic to contact this (former) Gold Apple Teacher about their concerns....it's been over one month.",,Responding to my previous comments would be a first step in making my customer experience better.,No,Yes,No,YTO,YTO,,https://scholasticnso.satmetrix.com/app/core/main/home.jsp#actions/1697563720183_16801,10/16/2023 0:00

Parents sign up to support this and I need to know if there will be a monthly book.  This year I ordered The Dot for September, but then Scholastic skipped over October and went right to There Was An Old Lady Who Swallowed A Turkey for November.  Will there be a December book?

It just isn't good to ask parents to buy more books when theirs have not been delivered. Because off the preset due dates, I had to immediately send out new order forms asking parents to purchase books and could only give them a few days to order. The results?  So far only one small order.",,This order came promptly but it was an order to replace books that were not properly ordered on your end. And one of the books I had to purchase privately on Amazon to complete the order.
