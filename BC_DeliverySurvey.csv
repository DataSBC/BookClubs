Emails from parents stating their child is upset because they did not get books. I have always handed out books quietly in bags to my students to put in their backpacks to take home. My school is an affluent school, but not everyone enjoys the luxury of having the means to purchase books for their child each month. This is an issue for my entire school. I would imagine it is a problem for other schools. It would my s also be VERY helpful to have the books already in bags labeled with each child’s name on it.

9/27/2023 6:47,Very Dissatisfied,dmabry@spcsjax.org,73863892_2023_01_6,My items are damaged;,"After 18 years (off and on) of Scholastic orders as a teacher and 30+ years of orders as a customer, this is the first time I am extremely dissatisfied with the status of my order. I am so disappointed.   I arrived at school this morning to the news that, yes, my order had been delivered, but that the box and books were destroyed. Come to find out, the delivery driver, whomever he or she was, chose to throw the box over the fence at our school near the mailbox (during a torrential downpour) instead of driving in and leaving it at the office. We are a small Catholic school and close one of the two gates at all times outside of arrival and dismissal for safety reasons. The gate near the mailbox is the one which is normally shut, but the main gate by the front office where deliveries are made was open. While I know that it was after office hours, we do have a table set up under the overhang we use for carline for any deliveries outside of the normal business/school day. I am crushed by this because, while ALL of the books got wet, a few are beyond saving. I don't see any way to post pictures but I have pictures of the box and the books.   Please advise as to how I should handle this with my families. They are looking forward to the books and were aware that they would be here within the week. Thank you so much for any assistance you can offer. Have a good day.",,,Yes,Yes,Yes,SOO,SOO,,https://scholasticnso.satmetrix.com/app/core/main/home.jsp#actions/1695753617320_6809,9/19/2023 0:00

I would love it even more if one such set was showcased at  a special  discounted price once a school year. Teachers could begin to build a books in boxes collection.  I would also like to see a special event where a selection of books were offered for a $1 for teacher purchase on one weekend of the school year. Books are expensive yet it’s so important that our students be exposed to the beauty of reading. I try to save money from each of my paychecks to be able to purchase classroom sets I can use with my whole class. I teach 3 grades of ELA. $5 a book times 25 students adds up quickly.  My students really enjoy reading as a class. Even my most reluctant readers enjoy the class discussions that are generated. Just one book can hinge a students life.,,Nope.

I typically spend between $300-$500 each year.  I am extremely disappointed in the Scholastic Book Order catalogs for this school year.  I feel the selections are limited and the increase in prices makes it less appealing.  Additionally, I have the done a ""forever books"" project the last few years where people have sponsored months and I was able to take advantage of the $1 books to give my students a new book to keep each month.  This year, I have one bargain book option (for $2).  I was unaware that you weren't going to continue to offer these $1 book options so my sponsors only donated $25 for the month.  I'm having to spend at least $11 each month out of pocket to even purchase a class set of the $2 books to carry on with this project.  Additionally, I dislike the new teacher rewards.  I used to collect lots of bonus points from my orders that helped get more books.  This year's September rewards are so disappointing.  I've been ordering from Scholastic for the last 17 years and I honestly don't know if I'm going to continue.  I'm extremely disappointed.  PLEASE go back to how it used to be.
