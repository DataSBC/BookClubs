Now, flyers will just appear anywhere (i.e. every other month, 2 consecutive months then skip a month, mid-month, end-of-month, etc.). This is very disruptive to the smooth flow you used to have each month, and we counted on it.  I can surmise that your new infrequent flyer policy is an attempt to cut costs on mailings and such, but I also realize that Scholastic is cutting back on teacher rewards.  We used to be rewarded each month with free books and higher bonus points if we had bigger orders.  It was a big deal to be a Golden Apple Teacher.  Now, we don't get monthly incentives to sell books for Scholastic, which amounts to cutting our rewards in half or more.  These things add up to a lose-lose for teachers and Scholastic.  It makes us want to quit Scholastic and look elsewhere.  I am not the only teacher that feels this way, as I have talked with many.  I would greatly appreciate an email or phone call to discuss this matter further if your company allows for that.  Thank you.  Patrick Purrington",,Please read this message in its entirety.

At the preschool, the children will be busy working on Christmas projects but our focus will be on the “Birthday of Baby Jesus”.  There will only be reading readiness on the first Wednesday this month because the children will be very busy with Christmas projects.  Reading Readiness will resume on January 4th.  To help teach the children the spirit of giving this holiday season we will set up a “Mitten Tree” outside the upstairs classroom.  Children are welcome to bring in new gloves, mittens, hats or scarves to hang on the tree on or before December 20th.  All donations will be sent to Lutheran Social Services in Uniondale.    The children at the preschool will present their Christmas Pageant in the church on Friday, December 23rd at 11:15 am.  All are welcome to attend.  Important Dates to Remember:  Monday, December 5th – Tuition is Due  Wednesday, December 7th – Last reading readiness for the month   Wednesday, December 14th – No Reading Readiness until January 4th    Monday, December 19th – Santa will visit the preschool!  Tuesday, December 20th – Last day to bring in donation for the Mitten Tree (see above)  Wednesday, December 21st – The children will enjoy fresh baked Christmas cookies for snack   Friday, December 23rd - Christmas Pageant at 11:15am, all are welcome to attend and Christmas Class Parties  Monday, December 26th through Monday, January 2nd – Preschool Closed for Christmas holiday  Tuesday, January 3rd and Wednesday, January 4th – First days back to school in 2023  The cold/flu/COVID season is now upon us.  Please remember that if your child is a little under the weather consider keeping them home. Your child’s classmates and teachers will thank you!  Have a Blessed Christmas!

Scholastic must have set a due date for my class and when a family placed an order the order was sent without my knowledge. I would normally add to the orders and put in my Apple points, but did not know there was a set due date I didn't create. Last year, I had many orders, this year I do not. I would like Scholastic to go back to the previous method of placing orders. If Scholastic sent me an email to notify me about the order placed, I did not see it. Scholastic sends MANY emails. My families need to see flyers to go to Scholastic. They do not naturally go to the website,  Another thing that has bothered me for some time is the books offered through your company. Can you put books in the flyers that encourage students to read good, wholesome, well written books like Beverly Cleary and others? When I see books that are less than on the pages, I wonder if we should continue with Scholastic.

They do not have credit cards to order school pictures. This year, with the shift to all online orders, students wistfully look at the flyers but many do not have internet at home. Until this year, my students would bring in change, birthday cash, and stacks of small bills to order books. They never calculated tax so I would pay that myself. They would excitedly ask almost daily when the books would arrive and the joy they expressed was overwhelming. Our children do not have books in their homes. They don't have transportation to go to the library. We don't have librarian support for the second year here in our school library - our students can not check out books. I have developed a belief that Scholastic is only for middle class families, and with inflation and your books that are now $5.99 instead of  $5, I see yet another corporation that is greedy. I am very disappointed in a company that has been partnered with teachers since I was a child. My dad was a teacher and we didn't have much money for books but Scholastic was an affordable resource.
