I missed an opportunity to use the September bonus as well as use bonus points to purchase products.  I usually use a healthy amount of bonus points my first order to restock my classroom library; however, now I will need to wait for a later order. I found it difficult to change the order date (which was pre-filled by Scholastic) online to a later date which I feel contributed to me missing this mysterious deadline to submit the order on my own. This new policy clearly wasn't communicated clearly.  I also received my order forms late and still have yet to receive the October order forms. The bonus points awarded for September were abysmal; typically, I have a large order which garners one of the top tiers of bonus points - I think usually in the thousands, but this year I earned a mere 599, despite having an order in the $200 + range.

I can see why it would be helpful for forgetful teachers and to avoid situations where orders are placed, but submitted after certain deals/books are available. However, I wish it was an optional feature. I didn't realize it was on, so my student orders were submitted as two separate orders because some were put before the Scholastic set due date, and some were put after. Both were also submitted before I could include my own bonus point orders. I ended up having to call customer service to see if they would waive my shipping fee for my bonus point order because I would have needed to pay for shipping or wait a month for the next class order. They were nice enough to waive it, but in transferring my order to their system they also entered in some books wrong, so my order wasn't accurate.

Only a few of my 62 students ordered, but everyone was excited to see what those students got and to see my order for classroom books. I think the next order will be more successful. I wonder if there is an opportunity for parents to order gifts for their children that could be delivered to them at home without the big scholastic book clubs sign on the box. I think parents would love shopping for Christmas or other gifts this way. That would also be excellent if the teachers could get some credit for class libraries. I understand that it would take more packaging to mail to different addresses though. Kids could maybe go online and click on their favorite ideas for books for ""our class"" which could be associated to the parents' emails, so that their folks could see the results.

I am disappointed that the following changes have been made: the $1 book options after spending $100 are gone for teachers, $5 birthday coupons that I could purchase for my kids at a discounted rate are gone, increase in book prices making them less affordable for families and myself which also means less points towards my classroom, the book of the week at a reduced price has changed to monthly, and there are less options/flyers for kids.  My coworkers feel the same, and if things continue we have talked about stopping Scholastic book orders. It just isn't worth it to us to promote them to our families.

Sad that there was no  warning for the bonus catalog to change. Our school had been saving up for some of the electronic gifts so that was very disappointing. Also, the option for $1 books and to open the dollar book store. This helped us put books into the  student's hands that really needed them.

Most books seem to be regular bookstore/Amazon prices except for the single book that is priced cheaper to be the single draw to get attention.  I've also always had two flyers to send and now there is only one for preschool.  So again fewer titles from which to choose.  I'm not sure how I feel about the online ordering only.

I will probably order every single $2 book of the month. I also love love love the rewards points system as well. Thank you Scholastic for providing books to kids for so many years. I have very fond memories of choosing my own books at book fairs as a child. And I also love that Scholastic allows homeschools to use their service many businesses do not.,"I do have one complaint, the quality of paper on the books is a little thin. I know the savings is probably passed on to the customer but sometimes little hands have a hard time turning the pages or end up tearing them but it's nothing a little tape can't fix. Also it would be nice to see more Learning Resources products. I really like their manipulatives.   Another thing, I saw an article where you are giving librarians the option to opt out of diverse books. I see absolutely no problem with this, but ... I think there should be a division of LQBTQ and books about racial equity, etc. Many parents that want to opt out see a big difference between the two. I would like the children to have the opportunity to learn about and embrace other people's diversity, ethnicity and culture but I don't want my elementary aged kids to have any access whatsoever to anything regarding sexuality. That subject should be left for private conversations between parent and child when that child is ready. So maybe consider separating those 2 subjects. In fact I think the books regarding ethnicity should not even be in question, they should always be included in every book fair. Every child should be represented and they should be able to see themselves in the stories. But anything about sexuality needs to be left out.
