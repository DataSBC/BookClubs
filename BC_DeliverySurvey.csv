Now, I have no books to give my students for Christmas. I won't be ordering with Scholastic again.	I am very upset about your new ordering system. I couldn't pick a due date that works for me and my class, I tried to follow your very confusing schedule that you set and instead I apparently misunderstood it, so my order was sent out only three days after I sent a flyer home to my students, and the box was shipped automatically so I couldn't even place my teacher order. I have been ordering from Scholastic Book Clubs since 2005. I will NOT be ordering from Scholastic again, unless you fix this mess and go back to the old way of letting teachers set their own due dates and submit orders. I understand that busy teachers would forget to hit send, but honestly, all you should've done is send out a couple reminder emails to that specific teacher that he/she has parent orders on his/her account and they need to be submitted.

I conducted a Scholastic Campaign with friends and family with the understanding that a person could sponsor one student for @$10, assuring that student would receive at least one gifted book each month of the 10 month school year from me with the funding. With the discontinuation of the $1 Book of the Week and other $1 deals (even the 10 book sets for $10 is no longer available), I am not confident I will be able to fulfill my goal of giving each and every student a brand new age appropriate/grade level Scholastic book every month this school year. Regarding customer service, I placed this order to receive the special offer of bonus $/points on a certain day because the offer was only good through that day. Our school was closed the following week for Fall/Thanksgiving Break. I called the customer service line and spoke to one of your representatives, asking if the shipment could be delayed or alternatively, shipped to my home since no one would be at school the following week. I was told shipping to teachers' homes was no longer an option and that it would take 7 to 10 business days to ship so there was no need to hold shipment. I checked the tracking of the book box twice during the week we were closed to find the delivery service attempted delivery twice but failed due to no one being here to receive it. This caused undue stress because I was afraid it was going to be returned to you or worse, lost since it was undeliverable.

(She had a sibling of one of the orders.)  My account said my box was coming, addressed to me. I had told all of my parents that I would keep orders secret until I knew whether the items were supposed to be a Christmas gift.   The other teacher with kindness and good intentions dropped off the books with the student whose name was on the order, so they did make it to the right place. However, because of this mix-up, a Christmas surprise could have been ruined. I also had to spend a lot of time tracking down what happened because I never received a box that said in my account that it had been delivered with my name on it. This was time-consuming and frustrating. My account said the order was being shipped to me. The parents had selected me as the teacher for the order. But for whatever reason, the books were all lumped together with a completely different teacher.   I've already been frustrated with the content of some of the new books. I will likely not send out any more orders because it's not worth the hassle.

The parents do not like the new layout for ordering books. Our book orders are extremely down this year. Some of that is the confusion of ordering online instead of handing the teacher an order. I had two parents give up on the online system because they had a difficult time finding our class even with the code. They liked it when the description and price are right next to the book, not having to look around the list for it. It also seems like there are fewer books being offered. When we would get the Christmas order form it would have books from many other areas so they could order for older siblings or cousins. That was not offered this year. The delivery was amazing! We could not believe it was here so fast. Our order was complete, and we had all of our books.

As a result, I did not qualify for the same rewards (on one order) as I would have because my order got separated.  Plus, I had to track two different boxes. One book box sent me "delivered" notifications, but it apparently went to a sibling's teacher instead of me without Scholastic notifying me of the odd delivery.

When I live chatted about this with someone earlier in the year...that I like to be able to set my own due dates, the person on the other end from Scholastic assured me that I could still do this. So I set my due date last month, but before that date came and went, I was notified that the two people who had placed orders, those orders had been sent in and that I would be getting the box of books soon...What? I didn't get a chance to order books myself with this order or get the free books that I am sure I earned with the order sent in.  Then, I get the box of books with NO PACKING SLIP.  How was I to know who were to receive the books?

It didn't know until I went to put in this months order and found that the books I was ordering with point were still in my cart.  I lost out on the coupons.  This was very upsetting as the books were gifts for my students. I also only had two weeks between one order being due (November)and the next order due date (December).  Myself and another teacher have tried to change the dates on the fliers but cannot, even thought we are told we can send in an order at any time.  It is very confusing for parents when the website has a different order date from when the teacher would like orders due.	I would like more control over when orders can be placed.  In October it interfered with the book fair.  In September I didn't even have order forms to use that month and lost out on coupons given to me at the end of last year.  You tell us that the orders will be put in automatically but we are not given a time.  So if someone want to place their own order that morning they cannot.  I hate this new system.

It was accomplished via online “chat” and completed within minutes.  The missing book was at our school within days.  I and the receiving family are very satisfied with how the order was handled.  If ordering could be easier on teachers, it would be to separate the books by ordering family.  Separating books, with 27 kindergartners watching and asking, leads to recounts and bouts of frustration.  I’m sure this is not efficient for Scholastic and understand this is how we receive bonus points and, more importantly, books at such great prices.

I've written this before on your survey and I get no response from scholastic. Not all families have credit cards. I will probably stop using you as a way for my students to get books. I can get donations instead.		I feel like this is pointless. You haven't addressed my concern and I've written to you already. I will most likely not continue to have my students order from you. I've been teaching for 20 years and always encouraged my students to order books from scholastic. Now that you've changed the way students can order books it's very inconvenient for me and them. My students' families don't have credit cards. You've changed the way ordering online is done. You also no longer have $1 books. I supplemented my classroom reading program by buying class sets of books. I can no longer do that through scholastic. It's a shame, but I won't continue to order books from you.

Twice I thought the items I had in my teacher order were in the cart but they were not auto submitted with the family orders.

Then then next day, and it wasn't.  This continued on and on.  I kept checking the tracking number and the box hadn't moved from its location for 1 whole week!  However, Scholastic kept sending email notifications saying it was going to arrive tomorrow or the next day, which it didn't.  Also, one of my student orders was missing.  Just icing on the cake.  Many teachers are very dissatisfied with your recent decision to only send out flyers periodically.  This is a tragedy for some of us that reward our students' monthly reading goals with the gift of books.  Now, flyers will just appear anywhere (i.e. every other month, 2 consecutive months then skip a month, mid-month, end-of-month, etc.). This is very disruptive to the smooth flow you used to have each month, and we counted on it.  I can surmise that your new infrequent flyer policy is an attempt to cut costs on mailings and such, but I also realize that Scholastic is cutting back on teacher rewards.  We used to be rewarded each month with free books and higher bonus points if we had bigger orders.  It was a big deal to be a Golden Apple Teacher.  Now, we don't get monthly incentives to sell books for Scholastic, which amounts to cutting our rewards in half or more.  These things add up to a lose-lose for teachers and Scholastic.  It makes us want to quit Scholastic and look elsewhere.  I am not the only teacher that feels this way, as I have talked with many.  I would greatly appreciate an email or phone call to discuss this matter further if your company allows for that.  Thank you.  Patrick Purrington		Please read this message in its entirety.  I highlighted many issues that Scholastic should be aware of for all teachers countrywide.

We have a statewide battle of the books, and only 2 titles are available from Scholastic. If you offered more, parents would be ordering them like crazy.

I'm not sure why you made all of the new changes.  It's much harder to order when I can't set dates for my families.

No teacher EVER opens book boxes in front of the whole class, which is one of the reasons I was given for the change.  That would take up too much teaching time, and it would make all the kids feel bad that didn't get books. Plus, parents sometimes order them for gifts.

The preset order dates threw me off and did not allow me to plan based on my school and classroom needs and traditions. I tried to wait until the set parent due date had passed to start my class order period, but the teacher due date ended up cutting my order in half and processing and sending half of the order early. The problem with this is that I did not get the full value of my earned points since they were cut into two smaller orders instead of one big order. I didn't want to wait until after the teacher due date to start the campaign because there would not be enough time before our school let out for winter break.

I do not feel comfortable sending you the parents email addresses.  I thought  the old way of ordering was better for the parents and children.  It gave interaction between child and parent.  It gave responsibility to the children.  Something I try to remind myself as a classroom teacher is that not all students have everything each other has.  We can't assume all children or homes have access to the internet.  All students had the ability to place and order the old way.  This will eliminate some families from ordering books.

After writing about how frustrated I was with Scholastic in the last survey, I then talked about it at lunch with fellow teachers, thinking I must be nuts, that it had to just be me. Nope. Every teacher in the lunchroom proceeded to share stories of frustration with the changes this year. Stories of not placing a student order because we were supposed to call it in. Who has time for that during the busy school day?!?  Stories of missed 10 bonus money because we were busy with actually teaching and the orders were auto submitted for us, denying us the ability to choose our free books and/or use previous bonus points to order books.  I know you are aware that putting labels with the class code on it, separating the book orders, giving the kids class time to browse the book order, sorting the book order when it comes in, and answering parent questions about book orders is all entirely optional. Something teachers do because we love reading, we love matching books with children, we love promoting reading, we know that it doesn't matter what your read, it matters that you read.   With the exception of adding fun things for the kids to do in the book order, every other change you have made this school year is a stinker.

Not have random due dates set that don’t work with my classroom schedule. While I know you have those dates in advance they don’t always work with my classroom and school calendars. My order shouldn’t be automatically submitted on some random date.		1. Teacher should be permitted to select their own due dates that fit THEIR classroom. They should not be submitted automatically. This is just confusing and frustrating for most teachers.  2. Scholastic needs to go back to one order per month, you would sell more books and have more books getting into the hands of kids. My class orders have been the least they have ever been in my 21 years of teaching.

Let me choose when I want to submit my parent orders!  It's frustrating because I had teacher items I wanted too, but now would have to pay for shipping on those items (which I refuse to do when I met that criteria with parent orders).  Also, bring back the old rewards system!  Giving me $10 to choose a book goes nowhere when you've raised the prices on everything!  For example, I used to be able to get a book like Mr. Wolfe's Class for $10.  Now books like that are $12, so I can't use my coupon on them.  Or, I would be able to get 2 books, like a $6 and $4 choice or $8 and $2, but now I have random amounts leftover ($1, $1.50) and there are no selections for that price point.		Hate the parent auto submit dates.  Let us submit the dates.  There is little selection/variation in the books from flyer to flyer.  Flyers are all journals and junk items, so few books.

I would like to see more bargain books again, like the $1 books or even $2 books.  I realize that the cost of inflation makes $1 books harder to offer, but those cheaper books are what have made Scholastic a popular company for teachers and students alike for years.  Those cheaper books get people to order and then they will maybe order a few more books besides those bargain ones that will help to make more profits for the company and will still allow those who struggle to afford it able to purchase a new book from time to time.

Either I missed the communication about it or nothing was ever sent out.  I wish a bigger deal had been made about this so that we would understand why the change was made, how to see our order dates, and whether or not things can be ordered outside of that date.  This made it very confusing at the holidays as my order date was an inconvenient date in November, so I didn't send home fliers (thinking we could order in December).  Then I found out that we didn't have a December order date!  Nothing until after Xmas!  But then a parent placed an order on their own and I found out we actually could place orders without a due date.  It was all unnecessarily confusing.  I feel like this change could have been explained more clearly (and multiple times).  I also HATE logging in to the Scholastic website.  It does not autofill for you and it is super annoying to have a separate screen for one's name and one for the password.  Can't Scholastic be like every other website and let us do it all at once?  It is just inconvenient the way it is.  Otherwise, the ordering process was easy and the shipping time was acceptable.  Glad Scholastic is getting its house in order!

I feel like I need to relearn how to order books all the time. Navigating the site from year to year is not something I want to figure out.  I do not like that my order date is set by Scholastic. I've had a LOT less orders this year! I would still like parents to order on the flyer and send in $ to me if that is how they feel more comfortable.  Not everyone is on their computers.  Kids also liked filling out the order form, which was also a lesson. I think adding a large box to each book/item would be great for kids to check what they would like to order.

I ended up having 2 orders this month because I wanted to give families more time to order for our holiday book exchange. However due to the 22nd auto order date I had part of the order ship then and the other half on the 28th. When doing special activities or things with families I try to give them multiple weeks to order because paydays are different for people.   I've also had many parents express they are bummed there are not monthly flyers with multiple pages like there used to be. They have expressed that Scholastic Book Orders was a way they got their 6th graders to read.

It it disappointing that both of those options are no longer available.  As a company that caters to education, literacy and reading, this should be a 'go-to' for teachers.  As teachers generally spend a lot of their own income on their classes to have there own books at home, you have made that margin very small and almost impossible to do. Disappointing and frustrating to say the least.  This year compared to last year, I have placed one order and probably no more than that coming up.  Very sad for my preschoolers!!!

I can't change my due date.		Bring back the ability to change the due date.  Bring back the flyers.  Many of our low income families cannot access the flyers and everything online.  Bring back the lower cost books.  I have bought books monthly for my students for over 20 years.  I can no longer afford to do so since you have very few books below $5.00.  Increase the selection for older kids.  I buy books for my 3rd grader often, but there are none that interest her available in scholastic.  And while it's not a book order issue, the amount of quizzes you have in reading counts stinks.  Once I use my accumulated points I will not be ordering from scholastic again unless things change.

12/3/2023 11:25	Very Dissatisfied	rkumpf@boyertownasd.org	74762825_2023_01_o		This is my 17th year using Scholastic.  I am not sure the reason behind the changes, but I can tell you that my class has less orders because of less paper order forms, and that they are not monthly.  Parents are not going on randomly to order books.  It is the order forms in the classroom that get kids excited.  They love circling books and talking about them with their friends.  There is a "rhythm" to the monthly orders and now parents don't know what to expect.  I am also very frustrated with how my one or two orders in the cart are randomly submitted.  When I go to place my complete order I lose money to add to my rewards for free books.  I feel so out of whack with this new system that it makes me not want to submit orders. Please go back to normal Scholastic - I can only imagine your sales are down.

With that feature being gone I will not be ordering much anymore and from my knowledge, neither are many others. With dual language programs growing in schools, Spanish books were an essential section for our schools and now the number of Spanish or bilingual  books is very limited, therefore, not supportive of our only affordable option for purchasing books. My students really want to place orders through me and bring their money but the website is no longer user friendly for this as I cannot enter students names anymore.

Also, the rubbery substance makes it much harder to separate the flyers. Several flyers broke as I was trying to separate. The 3 staples used before made it quick and easy. I also miss receiving the booklets in the order box. The community I service doesn't use technology so the children bring me cash and now I have to order under my name instead of being able to type in their name. I actually feel less inclined to continue ordering the way things stand currently. Please reconsider making ordering easier for busy teachers. Thank you.

I've been teaching for 25 years and most of that time I've purchased book coupons so that my students could use it to pick their very own book as a present. Many families can't afford to purchase books so this was an opportunity for those children to be able to pick their own book just like all the other kids. It's not financially feasible for me to do this and pay $5 for every student so being able to purchase the booklet of coupons was a great option. I know that you offer packs of books that I could purchase that are less expensive but this takes away from the child being able to choose their own book.  Again, this was extremely disappointing that you haven't made this available. ~Vicki Kreider			No	Yes	Yes	SOO	SOO		https://scholasticnso.satmetrix.com/app/core/main/home.jsp#actions/1701197799867_38641	11/18/2023 0:00

However, I wanted to share that I feel the price of the books have gone up a lot this year.   I truly promoted Scholastic to my parents to buy books from Scholastic Book Club due to the affordable prices of the books in the past.   However, this year I find that the books are much more expensive this year and there are not the 1.00, 1.50, or 2.00 books for them to choose from..   As a teacher, I spent over $200.00 on my order in November and only received 10.00 in free books.  That has changed a lot this year.   I also enjoyed the 1.00 bookstore you had last year for teachers if our orders were over 75.00. This enabled me to purchase a book a month for my students.  I am not able to get my students a book a month due to the high cost of some of their favorite books.    If at all possible, could you bring back the 1.50-2.00 book specials or the 1.00 store if you spend over a certain amount.  Thank you for listening.

I have used Scholastic for 6 years and fundraised with my family and friends so that each child in my classroom could have a new book to take home each month, but when you took away the $1.00 books, and then the $1.50 books, and then took away the Judy Newman"Book of the Week" deals - it has become almost impossible. The few value packs you offer are over priced and the 20 books for $20 all have mismatched books in them (its obvious you use these to clean out your inventory).

Now I have to place orders as one big one with no name to each students name so I have to write a note down to keep track who ordered what. Also Scholastics started charging taxes and I work at a low income community in which our kids barely bring enough money to cover for their items, now I have to ask them to bring extra money for their taxes. For us in the library it is hard to cover for everyone's taxes. Plus Scholastics used to offer $1 in which that was affordable for some kids to feel like they made a big purchase from Scholastic and made them have a smile on their face when they knew they could afford something from Scholastics.

12/1/2023 13:20	Somewhat Dissatisfied	alex_leith@wrsd.net	74712350_2023_03_x		I was satisfied with the delivery. I was completely dissatisfied with the change to automatic due dates. The due date did not work with when I sent home the flyer. This resulted in some parents placing an order and others choosing not to because the other orders were already submitted. I did not place an order this time around because I did not know about the automatic due dates, so I missed out on using the $10 to spend on that order and the free shipping. This change has made me way less likely to place orders in the future. I find it hugely inconvenient and it makes it difficult for me to give parents extra time if they have forgotten to place an order by a due date. I had an email exchange with a rep and she explained why the change was made, but I do not find it to be a time saving feature. I also have never forgotten to submit a parent order. I would greatly appreciate it, if the ordering went back to the way it was before.

It keeps us wanting to send out messages about ordering. One thing I wish, is that before the holidays the $1 club could open back up. I have a big class that has 25 students and I buy them gifts each year with my personal money. I usually bus each child a book as well, but with the books I want for them being $3 or $4 that adds up to cost too much. I still love everything about Scholastics though!

I have been a Gold Teacher for years, spending several hundreds of dollars over the course of the school year.  The incentives for teachers in the past were great and this year, you've taken them all away.  I used to earn so many bonus points that allowed me to purchase additional books for my classroom.  Also, the book selection this year has been very lacking. I would love to see you bring back the book bundles (5 for $5) as I try to gift my students with books each month that they take home and the selection and $2 price is very disappointing.  I've started looking elsewhere for book deals.  I always used to promote the monthly catalogs with my class and the new catalogs are not great.  Additionally, it's December 1st and there is no December online catalog currently available as of this response.  Come on Scholastic Book Clubs... bring back your old ways!!!

Scholastic hardly sends out flyers anymore. I love being able to send home paper flyers with my students because I have some with no internet and this allows them to order as well. Plus the kids can see the books and items and circle things they want. It usually will boost monthly sales. I used to place large orders each month. Now I am lucky to place an order every couple months. I love to get money for students to get one book each month.

I used to have lots of parents order the value pack/grade level packs. Now, it is much more pricey and my parents go elsewhere for books.

11/30/2023 21:19	Very Dissatisfied	mguibord@neillsvillek12.org	74664748_2023_01_6		Scholastic’s new ordering system is restrictive with its preset due dates. It does not provide flexibility for teachers to set the due dates based on our school calendar, parents pay schedules, and it restricts our ability to provide access to books in a poor, rural district. If we miss the preset due date, Families are out of luck and have to wait until whenever Scholastic permits an order.  This new way is restrictive and inconvenient for families and schools.		I am very disappointed in the new business model that Scholastic Books has adopted. I have always been a very loyal customer and was religious about sending out book orders every month. Being a teacher in a poorer, rural district, I have frequently had parents express gratitude for helping their child learn to love reading and providing the opportunity for them to easily get affordable books because access to books is difficult for a variety of reasons. Additionally, I have also had elementary students bring in their own money to buy a book because their parents told them “no” and they really wanted a book. I have personally purchased hundreds of dollars of books for gifts for students and for students to read as part of my classroom library. I do not understand why Scholastic would choose to make a system that is more restrictive and less accessible for families and teachers.

For one, the prices have increased drastically.  Scholastic is no longer the cheapest option for buying books.  I can find the cheaper in places like Marshals, Home Goods, and Hobby Lobby.  I recently went to a scholastic book fair at my daughters school and dropped $28 on 2 softcover books and a silly pencil.  That's absurd.  I previously had parents who can not afford books purchase the $1 and $2 book monthly.  Now these are only available to teachers and only after meeting a minimum purchase requirement.  I also used to purchase these books for Christmas and end of the year gifts.  I don't do that anymore.  In the past, I even had families purchase the inexpensive options for birthday party favors.

The prices have gone up for all books, and it no longer feels like a value that I am offering families or a value as a place to shop as a teacher. The strucutred due dates are somewhat limiting and it's been a challenging adjustment without any communication or heads up from Scholastic. I've been using this program for over a decade, and this is the first year I'm considering it may not be worth my time. I also think the rewards structure has declined-- there are fewer ways to earn free books quickly for the classroom.		I entered my comments in an earlier box.

For example, I have to call a rep to secure a quote for what I want to buy, then I have to sign off in the quote, next I recieve an approved quote. Now, I have to wait for an invoice.  Then, I have to mail in payment, which came back to me in the US mail last time. So now, I call in to make payments and the you don't even have the option to call and type in the extension on the invoice to make payment over the phone. Instead, you call, leave a voicemail, and wait for a return that usually comes in at the most inopportune time. Here is what I want to do.

I had never had issues with Scholastic in the past and have used them for years (like 20!). I was so hesitant to order again. I  did not order the rest of that school year, and the next year (last year). I took a chance this year with the new system of online ordering only. Was a little hesitant, but decided to give it a try. Wonderful, easy experience. Thank you! I'm back!

I don't think I like the new system and not sure I understand it really. We have flyers that are due for parents on one day and teachers another day. We had flyers for Fall and then Holiday but the due dates didn't make sense. I liked the old way with flyers each month. The flyers are no longer informative. They don't tell you much about the books anymore and the prices are not reasonable for all. I teach in an urban district, where most of my parents will not be able to order online. The paper order form was easier for most of them. I think I am thankful I am at the end of my teaching career with some of the changes made with technology. Some of it is not treating everyone fairly.			No	No	Yes	SOO	SOO		https://scholasticnso.satmetrix.com/app/core/main/home.jsp#actions/1701195528229_5061	11/16/2023 0:00

When placing an order it is really hard to find books.  For instance, I teach high school and preschool.  For the preschool I would like to search preschool books for the letter T.  I would think that Scholastic, a company that caters to teachers would have a feature that would allow a teacher to search by subject and get a list of books!  If it were faster to find books for teacher resources I would buy much more from Scholastic instead of Amazon.

11/29/2023 6:20	Satisfied	gracepreschoolnb@gmail.com	74815646_2023_03_j		Grace Lutheran Preschool December 2022 Newsletter  It is the most magical time of the year.  The Christmas season is here!  At the preschool, the children will be busy working on Christmas projects but our focus will be on the “Birthday of Baby Jesus”.  There will only be reading readiness on the first Wednesday this month because the children will be very busy with Christmas projects.  Reading Readiness will resume on January 4th.  To help teach the children the spirit of giving this holiday season we will set up a “Mitten Tree” outside the upstairs classroom.  Children are welcome to bring in new gloves, mittens, hats or scarves to hang on the tree on or before December 20th.  All donations will be sent to Lutheran Social Services in Uniondale.    The children at the preschool will present their Christmas Pageant in the church on Friday, December 23rd at 11:15 am.  All are welcome to attend.  Important Dates to Remember:  Monday, December 5th – Tuition is Due  Wednesday, December 7th – Last reading readiness for the month   Wednesday, December 14th – No Reading Readiness until January 4th    Monday, December 19th – Santa will visit the preschool!  Tuesday, December 20th – Last day to bring in donation for the Mitten Tree (see above)  Wednesday, December 21st – The children will enjoy fresh baked Christmas cookies for snack   Friday, December 23rd - Christmas Pageant at 11:15am, all are welcome to attend and Christmas Class Parties  Monday, December 26th through Monday, January 2nd – Preschool Closed for Christmas holiday  Tuesday, January 3rd and Wednesday, January 4th – First days back to school in 2023  The cold/flu/COVID season is now upon us.  Please remember that if your child is a little under the weather consider keeping them home. Your child’s classmates and teachers will thank you!  Have a Blessed Christmas! Personally, I am struggling with the new book flyers.  They are not as easy to read and it seems like there are less books. The website has also gotten harder to navigate.  I struggled to find lost cost books (I realize the $1 books may be a thing of the past) but it was hard to find age appropriate Christmas/winter books for my price point.

The rise in prices of the books makes it very difficult to get the most out of the $10 coupon. For example, due to one book being $5.99 and one being $2.99, I was not able to fully use the $10 which is discouraging. I think making the books an even dollar price would (ex: $4) would make it easier to use the earned rewards.

11/28/2023 18:43	Very Dissatisfied	heidi.hartnett@cvcsonline.org	74710765_2023_03_x		I dislike the new way of ordering with Scholastic. Scholastic must have set a due date for my class and when a family placed an order the order was sent without my knowledge. I would normally add to the orders and put in my Apple points, but did not know there was a set due date I didn't create. Last year, I had many orders, this year I do not. I would like Scholastic to go back to the previous method of placing orders. If Scholastic sent me an email to notify me about the order placed, I did not see it. Scholastic sends MANY emails. My families need to see flyers to go to Scholastic. They do not naturally go to the website,  Another thing that has bothered me for some time is the books offered through your company. Can you put books in the flyers that encourage students to read good, wholesome, well written books like Beverly Cleary and others? When I see books that are less than on the pages, I wonder if we should continue with Scholastic. I want to build my student's love for reading with good quality books.

I had saved my points for years to get a computer and now there aren't any. Also, the prices and points have gone up so much that it isn't worth my time. I am in the process of spending all of my points and then my time with Scholastic will sadly be done. I'm not sure what happened over the summer, but it is too bad for all of your loyal customers. I hope it works out well for you as I would hate to see any company suffer from poor management.		I feel like you really only want to ask questions about things that you are doing well like the shipping and delivery process. If you would like to do a customer survey about the new ordering system, the new look, the rise in prices, the absence of $1 books, the inability to put books in the hands of children at an affordable price, the inflated prices/points in the bonus catalog, etc. then you might actually be able to improve your services.

I had paper orders out and you filled the order before I could have completed it. This affects my bonus points and potentially money to spend on my classroom library. I think before you decide to just submit an order you email the teacher. I planned on doing it the following day once all of my students had time to return their orders.

11/28/2023 14:59	Very Dissatisfied	chele.sachs@pgcps.org	74722013_2023_01_y		I work at a Title 1 school with 90% of our students on free and reduced lunches. These families are immigrants. They do not have credit cards to order school pictures. This year, with the shift to all online orders, students wistfully look at the flyers but many do not have internet at home. Until this year, my students would bring in change, birthday cash, and stacks of small bills to order books. They never calculated tax so I would pay that myself. They would excitedly ask almost daily when the books would arrive and the joy they expressed was overwhelming. Our children do not have books in their homes. They don't have transportation to go to the library. We don't have librarian support for the second year here in our school library - our students can not check out books. I have developed a belief that Scholastic is only for middle class families, and with inflation and your books that are now $5.99 instead of  $5, I see yet another corporation that is greedy. I am very disappointed in a company that has been partnered with teachers since I was a child. My dad was a teacher and we didn't have much money for books but Scholastic was an affordable resource. Is this a result of Scholastic's sell out to big ed business at a price of $575 Million?		The order schedule that you set for the last order was slated to arrive over the Thanksgiving break while school was closed. The delivery was attempted while the school was closed and did not arrive until today. The box was battered and opened on one end. Only one of the books was slightly damaged.

The new ordering system will create less orders.  Given the dynamics of the school's population, parents are not used to order bythemselves.  I would order for them.

I am so very disappointed that Scholastic is not carrying some of the good classic story books and read-aloud for preschool/Kindergarten children.  There are too many commercialized books which is not good literature and will not stand the test of time.  Please consider bringing back good literature.		If Scholastic didn't have the monopoly on monthly book ordering, I would look for a different company based on this year's changes.  I do not like that Scholastic sets the due date for orders, the flyers are not getting parents to order and the prices have really gone up.

11/28/2023 13:48	Somewhat Dissatisfied	erekedal@fergusotters.org	74724887_2023_01_6		My coworkers and I have been frustrated with the new system Scholastic has. In past years, we are easily shown what students have ordered and can send in the order when we are ready. This way, we are able to get points. Our points are not coming to us and orders are sent in before we get a chance to look at them. For example, we will get an email and info saying we can get $10 off our teacher order with a class order over $25, but this is not happening. I am giving families very little time to put in orders in hoping then I will be able to see the orders before doing my teacher order. I have ordered few Scholastic books for my classroom library due to this issue.

The online only method of ordering for parents has significantly reduced the number of orders that are submitted.  The number is down 75% over last year.		Send catalogs on time to me.  Return the paper option for ordering.  I probably will just use up my bonus points and not use Scholastic in the future.

I still had parents submitting orders because I gave them my own due date, which is another huge complaint- not being able to set my own due date anymore. I don’t want to follow the schedule set by Scholastic.  That doesn’t work for me. I can no longer give parents the link because the due date never fits what I want. I try to do it on my own, and then the website automatically placed an order before I was ready to place my class order. These two factors have ruined book orders for my class, and if this is not changed back to the way it used to be, I will no longer participate in book clubs with my class.

11/28/2023 13:15	Satisfied	sherri.mullet@eastholmes.org	74740477_2023_01_6		I have never had trouble with getting families to order books, but they are not ordering this year. This order was actually ordered by me (the teacher) and the books are for me (and Christmas gift books for my students). The idea that families no longer have the chance to place an order with a PAPER form has greatly impacted their decision to order. I wish order forms would still include the paper order form! Many of our families are Amish and so scanning a code is not beneficial or reasonable for them.		I'd love for you to bring back the book order forms with an order form included! Not only will my students suffer from not having books in their homes, but as a teacher, the points that I used to earn to purchase books will soon dwindle to nothing.

It seems like there are several more clicks to get to where I want to go on the new website format.		I didn't know I could track my order. I will watch for that in the future. This probably has nothing to do with Scholastic, but when I received my box it looked like it had been kicked or fallen off of a truck! It was pretty damaged, although everything inside was fine.

I wish you would still have the receipt itemized and able to tear out to place on the books being sent home.  Also, the price increase has severely limited the number of books being ordered and has alienated the poverty/low income families.  I buy a book a month for each student and there are (if ever) very rarely books under $2.  Also, there are so few books at this price point that all the children in the grades PK-2 are getting the same book from their teachers. Also, this is a book that could potentially be bought by a family that only has $2 to spend. The push for everything to be done online has also turned off families from ordering.  They only have the option of digital money and a lot our demographic do not have this option.  It's also one more thing to do.  Previously they could look through the book order together and circle books and send me cash if needed to get a book for their child. I understand this is more efficient on your end. But I feel that between the increase in cost of the books and lack of options for purchasing is alienating many people in our community.

11/27/2023 10:45	Somewhat Dissatisfied	jstrong@swms.wnyric.org	74727981_2023_03_x		Delivery was fine. The items came quickly and were correct. The part that is frustrating is that we can no longer put in student orders that come in from home. Not all kids/families are able to do online ordering, so taking this option away is discriminatory towards families. Also, I do not like Scholastic deciding what day orders are due, and submitting orders before I am ready to. Lastly, prices of books are way higher than they used to be. I know there is inflation in the world right now, but it is really frustrating. Scholastic used to be where teachers and families could get books cheap...now, not so much.		My only other comment is it might be worth going back to how things were...letting teachers control when to submit orders and when book orders are due. I know of many unsatisfied teachers right now because of all of these changes.

This was a great way for teachers to get books in their students hands!!!  But gosh at $2 or $3 or wow $5 per book - and at 20 students . . . yeah that won't be happening!  It's a bummer because Scholastic was supposed to be a cheaper way for families to order books for their children while benefiting the classroom. Not so much anymore. I can buy books (and families too) at Target or Amazon or Barnes utilizing their sales of buy 2 and get one free or just a percentage off. Scholastic, please reduce your prices. This is so sad.

In fact, this will probably be the only order I place this year, due to that. Teachers pay for a lot of items from our own pockets. A company that prides itself on being there for the students and the teachers ought to actually be there for them. I ordered all the time when there was free shipping. It was easy to place an order from my computer at school, and know that I was getting quality products without an extra cost of shipping. Now that I have to pay shipping, I am wasting my money on gas to drive to a local bookstore, and take more time away from my personal life, such as time with my sons and husband, to go find books that may or may not be what I am looking for. I am very disappointed that you are asking teachers, who don't make much money to being with, to now pay shipping. If that doesn't change, then this will likely be my last year buying from you.		Shipping should be free, no matter how much the teacher spends! We pay for so much out of pocket already that it would be nice to have a company who prides itself on being there for students and teachers to actually support them!
