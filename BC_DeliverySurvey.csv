Giving parents the option to pay online or in person via teacher was great but now it's all online. Some parents are continuing to pay with checks and giving it to me, so I was told by rep there's a tax that is added since I am paying as a teacher.  That is SO wrong!  There is NO option for families to pay through teachers anymore.  And if they do, we as teachers, are responsible for all the taxes because we're not going to be asking parents for another dollar once the check is written.  I usually have a lot of students ordering but this is the FIRST year where I only have 2 and that's it.  I asked the parents and students why and they said it's too much of a hassle.

This means, if a parent waits until the middle of October to buy books, I have to wait a whole 2 months to get books for my classroom. Plus, the more money that is spent, the more bonus points I earn. So I'm at a complete disadvantage to earn free books for my classroom with bonus points by putting in orders right away. If a parent puts in an order in September, I purposely won't submit that order until October so that I can try to build up my bonus points. That's ridiculous for both parties involved.
