It also allows me all month to set reading goals for kids to earn a free book pick from me.  Therefore, since I send them out the first week, I also need the flyers ahead of that first week to separate them and hand them out.  However, due to the way you have your system set up, flyers do not arrive in time unless we order them as soon as they become available to order, which makes me continually check your website to try and order them the moment they are available.  This last box came just in time (Friday), so that I could have them ready for Monday.  That's too close...way to close, and doesn't give me ample time to get them ready.  Please make the next month's flyers available to order and arrive BEFORE the first of the month.  Also, I am not able to set my online due date for book orders.  I need to be able to set my own due date.  What has happened is that I put in my order on the first week of the month, but because you allow parents to order way beyond that, I have to keep ordering and ordering as the orders keep coming in.  That's not fair to the students, as my first order will arrive way before the last student's order arrives, they will see their peers getting their books before them, and that can cause anxiety and hurt feelings.  Also, it takes away my ability to maximize bonus points.  Instead of being able to have one huge order and get all of the benefits that come with that, I end up getting a bunch of little orders that don't get me what I should have earned with a larger order.

I do an incentive in September where I give each student who orders a free book in a later order if we reach $300 because of your 10,000 bonus point initial order you always gave in the past. Very disappointed that’s gone. I had to contact customer service because the $1 books weren’t popping up, only to discover that is gone too. The representative said the price hike and bonus point drop are to keep providing “the newest books in quality condition” but the selection of $2-3 books was very limited. I had to spend almost $5 per student to get a winter-themed book for my class, which took the same amount I would have spend for five holiday books in the past! But since you didn’t even offer any Halloween books they’d enjoy at a reasonable price, I guess it doesn’t matter that I blew my whole budget on one Christmas book. I was very disappointed in the selection, the prices, and the lack of bonus points. I’ve forgiven a number of issues over the last five years due to Covid, such as my bonus point bank balance being incorrect with no one manning customer service to help and my recommended books still sending me fourth grade titles even though I’ve registered as a first grade teacher for the last three years and changed the grade everywhere I could find, but these are changes I cannot get over.",,"Please read what I wrote in the first section. I understand the need to raise prices overall, and of course inflation will happen, but I don’t understand keeping teachers from using your services to get books into the hands of their students. That’s what your changes are going to do. I used book fairies to get 5-8 books per year into the hands of my students over the course of the school year, and with your changes in going to be lucky to get 2 per kid now. Honestly it’s not going to be worth the effort when I could pick up limited selections like you now have for cheaper elsewhere.

9/30/2023 6:52,Satisfied,sarahschertz@stthomas-school.net,73848919_2023_01_6,,"I do not like the changes to scholastic book clubs that have happened this year. Not being able to set my own deadline is confusing when I tell parents one deadline but the paperwork I send home and the website says a different deadline. If a parent misses my deadline thinking the deadline you set is correct, then I've missed out on including that in my order total for this month and accruing bonus points/rewards on this month's order and it won't just save to be added to next month's order total and help accrue bonus points/rewards for next month either because you will auto-submit the order at the end of the month. I know I will still receive bonus points but the higher the total amount sold, the higher tier you achieve in rewards/bonus points each month so this new system is messing with that process. As a teacher I rely on those bonus points to purchase books to give my students as gifts at Christmas, the end of the year and for the classroom.   I received only 1 flyer for the beginning of the year and none for the month of October. I teach prek so without the flyers, unless the parents make the decision to log them in to scholastic to look at the books, they cannot see what books are available or even know that there is a book order. Even if they didn't order from the book order every month, looking through the book order sparked their interest in what books are out there and helped foster a love of reading. Abd often, if kiddos were able to look at the books and see one they liked, parents were more likely to log on and look/order books for them. Otherwise, out of sight, out of mind. The one flyer I did receive was very sparse and had lots of blank space as well as toys instead of books. This is the book order, there should be plenty of books to fill the pages and there is no need to put toys and other stuff in there. As a parent that would turn me off to the book order to see them trying to hawk useless stuff at my kids when the focus is supposed to be books.   The changes to the way you can see the books online this year is also very frustrating. When i tried to enter my teacher order and look through the available books, all of the teacher catslog items were mixed in with the books. It made the process tiresome and lengthy to try to find books i was interested in. Teacher bonus catalog items should be in a separate catalog. Please return to the previous layout. It worked fine and there were lots of great books. Looking this year, there was not much choice and there seemed to be tons of iterations of the same book over and over again. More original content and classic books for young children please to foster the love of reading. Also, I know with inflation the cost of books has risen but it was almost impossible to find any books under $3 or even $5. Again, as a teacher, I rely on those low cost books to be able to afford purchasing them for my 10-20 students several times each year. Also please return to flat dollar amounts for each book or at least put them at dollar and half dollar amounts. The amounts with random change amounts was annoying.   All that said, the order came quickly and without issue. I still love Scholastic Book Clubs as I have since I was a kid and since I became a teacher 15 years ago. It makes me sad and worried for the direction book clubs are going to see these changes and for the future of book clubs. I ask that you please consider these changes and whether they are really serving your customers.

Teachers aren't getting raises to combat inflation either and I think it is sad that a company targeting teachers wouldn't do everything they can to ensure teachers are able to put books in their students hands. Scholastic is just like every other company out there-- the bottom line is all they care about is the bottom line. This is why I will no longer do business with Scholastic after my last order. I have decided to withdraw my business from companies like this and support the authors and illustrators directly.

I am so disappointed.   I arrived at school this morning to the news that, yes, my order had been delivered, but that the box and books were destroyed. Come to find out, the delivery driver, whomever he or she was, chose to throw the box over the fence at our school near the mailbox (during a torrential downpour) instead of driving in and leaving it at the office. We are a small Catholic school and close one of the two gates at all times outside of arrival and dismissal for safety reasons. The gate near the mailbox is the one which is normally shut, but the main gate by the front office where deliveries are made was open. While I know that it was after office hours, we do have a table set up under the overhang we use for carline for any deliveries outside of the normal business/school day. I am crushed by this because, while ALL of the books got wet, a few are beyond saving. I don't see any way to post pictures but I have pictures of the box and the books.   Please advise as to how I should handle this with my families. They are looking forward to the books and were aware that they would be here within the week. Thank you so much for any assistance you can offer. Have a good day.",,,Yes,Yes,Yes,SOO,SOO,,https://scholasticnso.satmetrix.com/app/core/main/home.jsp#actions/1695753617320_6809,9/19/2023 0:00
