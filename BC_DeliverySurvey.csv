Many families do not have/use computers and don't have credit cards. So they need to turn in cash/check orders. You have switched to a very classist ordering system. It's now difficult for me to know what they want to order because you took away the physical order sheet on the order magazines. You also force me to enter all my student flier orders under my teacher account. This makes it very challenging when the books arrive knowing which books go to which students. I have to take out all the physical order forms and flip through each page to know what each family ordered. You also didn't provide a pre-stamped envelope to send in checks. I'm very disappointed with your thoughtless push for online ordering. You are catering to the middle and upper class families and making things more difficult for the poor communities and the teachers that serve them.,,"bring back easier ordering for student flier orders with cash/checks.

Not under my order history, not in my cart, not anywhere on my account. It was like it didn't exist. I logged out and in again, thinking it was a glitch. Then reading on the website, it sounded as if the order had been automatically submitted based on the new protocol of if they order beyond a particular date. So I thought, well, okay. I got the email and it must have been automatically submitted. However, a week later, I logged onto the Scholastic website to set my next month's due date to find something in my cart. It was the same family order that I was under the impression had been automatically submitted since I could not find it anywhere. It was now sitting in my cart, and had been for over a week. I submitted the order right away but needed to email the family and apologize as they would now be waiting over 2-3 weeks for their order because of this.

2/3/2024 9:18,Very Dissatisfied,johnkalkowski@hotmail.com,75100487_2023_02_6,,"Delivery...nothing. Overall Book Clubs...Scholastic has really declined in the past 5 years. I think it is due to three factors which are probably all related to Scholastic trying to increase profit or offset declining profit. First, the economy tightened pocketbooks...I don't know how to fix that. Secondly, the book selection has really dwindled. The catalogues are all the same--same books from order to order with few new options and way too many gimmicky ""toys."" I had been a gold member for as long as there has been such a thing, but students no longer are excited to order because they aren't finding a selection that entices them. I lost my gold status a couple of years ago as my student orders declined from a typical order of $300+ each month to around $30 only a couple of times a year. I'd say the third thing is that there's not much to encourage a teacher to participate any longer. For 20+ years I earned large teacher coupons so I could order books for free with student orders. There are still $10 coupons offered typically, but one can only get a single book with the prices now. In the past, there were always highly discounted titles, but now a catalogue will only have one or two and they are always the same old things. This goes for the bonus catalogue as well. Where's the technology? Over my lifetime with Scholastic, I was able to earn with bonus points enough to get a laptop, an ipad, and $300 in gift card to Target. I don't see any options like that any longer. Scholastic has sharply declined and I truly believe Scholastic has put themselves out of business in the near future with the managerial decisions they've made to cut costs. My students are no longer ordering and I am doing nothing differently than I have for the past 28 years. So something has changed with Scholastic book clubs. Trying to maintain profit levels at the expense of dooming the overall business doesn't make sense.",,,No,Yes,,SOO,SOO,,https://scholasticnso.satmetrix.com/app/core/main/home.jsp#actions/1706816581300_6737,1/25/2024 0:00
