I had to make a separate call.","My students and I have been ordering from Scholastic for over 30 years. I have never had a complaint about Scholastic! However, I feel like there were too many changes this year and not one was beneficial to teachers or families. This is the first time I have been dissatisfied with Scholastic.   First, I would like to place orders when I am ready to place the orders, and not go by the company's time schedule. Sometimes they need to be timed between school breaks, special occasions, or book fairs, which is difficult to do the new way. The orders are placed automatically when I do not have all orders in. This messes up bonus points, shipping, free books, etc. I know I can place additional orders at any time, but this just makes more work. Also, if additional orders are placed, kids in class end up getting their orders at different times, which is hard for little ones to understand.   Regarding bonus points, I have been teaching for a long time and have a classroom full of books and other supplies. I still order some books with bonus points, but I really am disappointed you can no longer use points for gift cards. I used mine toward Target in previous years, and there was no warning you were discontinuing this. I would have used up all of my points last year. Please bring gift cards back!   I also miss the fun of trying to reach a certain number of bonus points each month. The bonuses were truly bonuses. Bonus points are slim this year, as are free books, and other true incentives. In the past, I would order myself to get up to certain bonus levels, but no longer do this. I know you are getting less sales from me personally and I would guess less from others as well.  A few other things I noticed were:   Book selection has lessened greatly.   Prices have gone up a lot.   I still have families who want to place orders with checks, so this was a hard change.   These last three are not as major to me as the things listed above, and are probably a sign of the times, but I do not remember seeing any advance notice about any of these changes. I understand that changes need to be made, but one a year rather than 10 things at one time would have been nice. Warnings about them the previous year would have been appreciated.  Please note that I am not a complainer, but I have been hearing the talk about Scholastic in the school lounge.

1/3/2024 12:01,Satisfied,sickr@dansvillecsd.org,74946470_2023_01_6,,"I am disappointed with the changes made this school year. I have had very little participation from families in book orders this year. Things to consider: Online ordering isn't actually ideal for most families. I have had many grandparents order in previous years that now don't because of this. In general, families feel safer being able to send in cash/check and not entering their card information into a site.   Additionally, our district is a Title 1 district. And while we understand that costs go up for everyone, not having the $1 and $2 book choices has affected many of my families' ability to order, even if only once in a while. On that same note, lower-income families tended to be able to send in a few dollars and I could process the order for them. Ordering online has not been an option for them.   As a teacher, I don't like not being able to set my own due date. Our school year doesn't start until September and I like to give families a couple weeks with each flyer before submitting the orders (and I don't always get the flyer out on the first of the month).
