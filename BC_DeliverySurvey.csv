I told the representative this and she would still not give me the flyers and no  consistency is not ok. Instead now I am a month behind. The October flyer is being submitted mid November. This is not great especially because the children will be getting Halloween books after Halloween. If the flyers will be coming out later the flyers should represent that and Halloween books should be in the September flyer and Thanksgiving books should be in the October flyer. Additionally, with the date (kind of being set) for me on the teacher's desk and it being longer than I usually gave families to order. I ended up submitting multiple orders so families didn't need to wait as long which led me to not getting the $10 in free books even though my second order and third order during the month would have qualified.

Most of my students pay in cash. I had a student bring me $23 in quarters for the most recent order. Expecting families to purchase online only is disappointing. I also often have students bring 1-3 dollars, all they have, but who want to purchase something.   No longer having the option to enter student orders made the ordering more difficult and I have heard a few other teachers at my school say the same. Also, I didn’t know about the changes, and when you search scholastic student orders that page came up so I had entered the orders that way. But, when I went back to the orders a few days later, those orders and the one parent order I had disappeared.   I was able to easily retrieve the online order by calling customer service. I had to re enter all the other orders.   I wish scholastic would consider changing back to student orders, as well as find a way to provide cheaper books like you once had.

We had a line that took almost 2 hours to get through at parent night. Processing online card sales by manually calculating taxes and totals without an efficient receipt printing solution was hardly a fix. Whoever suggested this has not been in a crowded book fair in the past few years.   The fair was delivered really early and picked up really late, so my library was dysfunctional for almost two weeks.   My text notifications about arrival were weeks late. I just received the notification about the fair pick up a few days ago.   Customer service, including my rep, were rude and attempted to gaslight me by saying I was the only one with the issues I brought to their attention, even though other librarians in my district had the same issues AND different reps informed me these were nationwide issues.   I rely on All for Books round ups to prevent counting a lot of change, these were being taxed therefore making whole dollar amounts impossible to calculate. I spent so much time counting pennies. Customer service had conflicting info about how to resolve this issue each time I called. I eventually gave up because it was wasting my time.   I run classes during the fair and have extremely limited volunteer support. This fair was a nightmare. I also hated how it seemed like there were fewer cases and more boxes to unpack. No one has this kind of time.   This might be my last fair with Scholastic. The cost of Scholastic Dollars catalog items has increased substantially and it is cheaper to buy pre-processed, well-bound books with cash from other vendors. The amount of unnecessary hassle and complete lack of respect from my rep and customer support staff made the experience hardly worth my time.",,"If fairs don't improve, our district is partnering with another company.",No,No,No,SOO,SOO,,https://scholasticnso.satmetrix.com/app/core/main/home.jsp#actions/1698243757922_6007,10/20/2023 0:00

In the past you sent various paper order brochures (Kindergarten, Seesaw, 1st grade, etc.) which I sent home to families.  Now there is only one for K/1, one for 2/3 etc.  The current paper brochure has many fewer book selections, but instead includes sections of games to play.  And most importantly, there is NO PAPER ORDER FORM.  You are forcing everyone to only order online, which becomes an equity issue for our families.  Not everyone speaks English well enough or is comfortable enough or even able to order online (perhaps no credit card, etc.).  I offered families the possibility of marking the brochure with their choices and I would place the order on their behalf.  This would mean more work for me, as again there is no longer a paper order form in the brochure.  I called Scholastic and made my concerns known about this and was told that the new ordering process would decrease the work involved for teachers.  That is certainly true if students no longer make any orders on paper.  Sadly, during this last ordering period I only had 3 families order (online), where in the past it was 7-10 (even if it was just one book on a paper order form).    On a different note the books have gotten quite a bit more expensive, with individual paperback book prices increasing by $0.99 to $1.99 which is again financially unobtainable for our families.   If it is Scholastics' goal to support a child's joy of reading and buying their own book, then you have sadly failed.

Why would you combine two different flyers into one and then put less books in them?? No one needs a list to write on. Kids don't need to count turtles in their book flyer. They need to see books. Your website also is not user friendly, so if you're trying to drive traffic to your site by putting less books in your book flyers, it's not a good decision. And what's with the price hike? Where are my two dollar books? Why do I get $10 free with a qualifying order, but the only books I can get are $9.99? So there are less books to choose from and what is available is now overpriced. All of my parents have complained. Also, I know a woman running an in home daycare who is no longer able to distribute book orders because she's so small? You're losing out on business.
