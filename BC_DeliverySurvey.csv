Don’t even let me get started on the policy that you send books when I haven’t closed out my order.

I really would like the September flyers before school.

I told the representative this and she would still not give me the flyers and no  consistency is not ok. Instead now I am a month behind. The October flyer is being submitted mid November. This is not great especially because the children will be getting Halloween books after Halloween. If the flyers will be coming out later the flyers should represent that and Halloween books should be in the September flyer and Thanksgiving books should be in the October flyer. Additionally, with the date (kind of being set) for me on the teacher's desk and it being longer than I usually gave families to order. I ended up submitting multiple orders so families didn't need to wait as long which led me to not getting the $10 in free books even though my second order and third order during the month would have qualified. The first order was submitted by the family before I even had my book orders because that family had a flyer from a different teacher (since the other teachers had the book orders before I did)Since only one reward is allowed I think it would be great if it would be ok for the second order to qualify even if the first didn't.

So now I see why we couldn’t/didn’t have a chance to order.,Allow books to be sent to whatever address the teacher requires.  I used to teach in a large public school where many teachers order but now I’m in a small private school that rents space. Apparently Scholastic has two addresses for the school - a physical address and a post office box. As a teacher I do not have access to the post office box where some flyers were sent.   As for the books -they were left outside the gate.  There is no big “excitement “ that the books have arrived.

11/4/2023 19:09,Very Dissatisfied,mreklund@gmx.com,74480813_2023_01_t,Already addressed in the previous screen,"I am so incredibly upset with Scholastic I don't even want to encourage kids to read.  I have been ordering from your company for over 30 years (plus more if you count the books I bought as a kid). For the most part I have been happy with your products service and prices although it was a bit rough during the Covid year and a half.  I have been saving my bonus points for many years to get a new computer.  I knew the computer that operates the SMARTBoard in my classroom was starting to fail last year.  I was going to place an order with the bonus points towards the end of last school year but since I had a group that pretty much refused to read I figured I would wait and just order the computer with my first order this school year.  It is still a tough sell to get students to buy books these days but I am always pretty successful getting to the parents at Back to School Night. I set me due date with my students and parents, orders came in and then, before mine own due date I see that Scholastic decided to finalize my order all on their own.  Before my deadline for the students and parents, before I had entered my own order, before I could use the bonus money Scholastic provided and before I could place an order in the Bonus Catalog.  When I complained I got a polite response but its pretty obvious you don't think you need teachers as your middle man anymore.  Worse, when I went to place the order from the Bonus Catalog I was shocked to find that not only have you stopped offering computers but your new choices in the technology category include crayons, sand timers, staplers, and Silly Putty (seriously, Silly Putty?)  but no laptop computers and no desktop computers.  Seriously? How do these items qualify as technology?  Even the Flintstones had better technology than many of the items listed in the Technology category of your Bonus Catalog.  I am beyond disappointed.  Everyday I pray my computer starts so I can use the SMARTBoard.  Some days it does, most days it does not. The district does not support PC's anymore since they provided us with Mac Laptops so I am stuck either paying for a PC myself or finding one someplace else.  I had planned on that someplace else being Scholastic but alas, that is not going to happen.  To add salt to the wound I just read about your contest to award a couple of iPads to teachers because you are so committed to technology.  Seriously.....I can't even protest by not placing orders until you put computers back into the bonus catalog because sure enough, I had parents place orders with you and you processed them again without me (that is what this order was for).    I am pretty sure I am just going to get another canned response from Scholastic about this but this whole ordeal just sickens me.  Don't count on me making the effort I usually do to sell your books. You might still get a few orders from parents of my students but don't count on my promoting doing so for the rest of this school year nor into the future.  Obviously you don't think you need me anymore.

I only had one family order anything in October because it says something about joining a club which families do not want to do.  They want to be able to order a book for their learner once in a while, and your fliers make it look as if they have to join a club in order to get books.  I was NOT going to give you all of my student's family's emails.  I don't think that is my place or responsibility.  I have been a red apple teacher for several years, ordering every month during the previous school years.  I won't be sending a November flier out because I have nothing to send and by the time you send me one, it will be too late.

The first delivery attempt said no one was here. It's a public elementary school campus, obviously the office is only open from 7:30 am until about 4:00pm. Why did they attempt to deliver before or after those times? It was a bit frustrating when I received an email stating I was getting them ""today"" but it ended up being the next day. I don't know if you can communicate that to the post office, but I know you do pay a significant amount to them for delivery of your books.

Most of my students pay in cash. I had a student bring me $23 in quarters for the most recent order. Expecting families to purchase online only is disappointing. I also often have students bring 1-3 dollars, all they have, but who want to purchase something.   No longer having the option to enter student orders made the ordering more difficult and I have heard a few other teachers at my school say the same. Also, I didn’t know about the changes, and when you search scholastic student orders that page came up so I had entered the orders that way. But, when I went back to the orders a few days later, those orders and the one parent order I had disappeared.   I was able to easily retrieve the online order by calling customer service. I had to re enter all the other orders.   I wish scholastic would consider changing back to student orders, as well as find a way to provide cheaper books like you once had.

We had a line that took almost 2 hours to get through at parent night. Processing online card sales by manually calculating taxes and totals without an efficient receipt printing solution was hardly a fix. Whoever suggested this has not been in a crowded book fair in the past few years.   The fair was delivered really early and picked up really late, so my library was dysfunctional for almost two weeks.   My text notifications about arrival were weeks late. I just received the notification about the fair pick up a few days ago.   Customer service, including my rep, were rude and attempted to gaslight me by saying I was the only one with the issues I brought to their attention, even though other librarians in my district had the same issues AND different reps informed me these were nationwide issues.   I rely on All for Books round ups to prevent counting a lot of change, these were being taxed therefore making whole dollar amounts impossible to calculate. I spent so much time counting pennies. Customer service had conflicting info about how to resolve this issue each time I called. I eventually gave up because it was wasting my time.   I run classes during the fair and have extremely limited volunteer support. This fair was a nightmare. I also hated how it seemed like there were fewer cases and more boxes to unpack. No one has this kind of time.   This might be my last fair with Scholastic. The cost of Scholastic Dollars catalog items has increased substantially and it is cheaper to buy pre-processed, well-bound books with cash from other vendors.

In the past you sent various paper order brochures (Kindergarten, Seesaw, 1st grade, etc.) which I sent home to families.  Now there is only one for K/1, one for 2/3 etc.  The current paper brochure has many fewer book selections, but instead includes sections of games to play.  And most importantly, there is NO PAPER ORDER FORM.  You are forcing everyone to only order online, which becomes an equity issue for our families.  Not everyone speaks English well enough or is comfortable enough or even able to order online (perhaps no credit card, etc.).  I offered families the possibility of marking the brochure with their choices and I would place the order on their behalf.  This would mean more work for me, as again there is no longer a paper order form in the brochure.  I called Scholastic and made my concerns known about this and was told that the new ordering process would decrease the work involved for teachers.  That is certainly true if students no longer make any orders on paper.  Sadly, during this last ordering period I only had 3 families order (online), where in the past it was 7-10 (even if it was just one book on a paper order form).    On a different note the books have gotten quite a bit more expensive, with individual paperback book prices increasing by $0.99 to $1.99 which is again financially unobtainable for our families.   If it is Scholastics' goal to support a child's joy of reading and buying their own book, then you have sadly failed.

Then I either have to pay it (on top of the other many things I pay for my classroom) or I have to send the book orders back and tell them I can't order if it's just one student.  I understand shipping isn't cheap, but can those low orders just be piggy-backed onto another order that goes out to that same location (if possible)?  I'm not sure what the answer is.

The whole point of a Book Club is that all readers read the SAME book. Now, the cheapest options are $2.99 per book! When we started the program, we could do $1 per book. When I reached out via the chat function to ask about availability of these, I was directed to the value VARIETY packs, which does us no good if we are trying to give everyone the same book. Our PTO is considering alternatives to continuing to purchase book for our students through Scholastic. We understand that prices for everything have gone up, but 2 years ago, I could get $1-1.50 books, last year was $1.50-2, now there is exactly ONE $2 option and not many at the $3.
