1/1/2001,01:23:49 PM,3,"I had trouble finding where to submit my child’s teacher & when I found it, my entire cart was deleted so I had to start over. It would be better if the scholastic site worked seamlessly with the school classroom pages.",Website Suggestion,,,,

1/1/2001,12:09:53 PM,1,when I am at checkout and have $ to use - I should be able to pull up my wish list and add those books in.  This is very frustrating.  The system really needs to be easier for teachers.  We don't have time to navigate back and forth.,Website Suggestion,,,,
1/1/2001,12:09:11 PM,5,very well placed categories ans recommendations. Only feedback is that when I was on a recommendation page I liked 2 books and I clicked on 1 to add to cart but after that I couldnot go back to the same recommendation page and missed the second book I had liked. I then had to search for it again.,Website Suggestion,,,,
