I wanted information about YA LGBTQ+ books in the RIF catalogue. I was given an answer about LGBTQ+ books in general in the larger catalogue. Also the search engine algorithm you use for some reason things that dragons are LGBTQ+ related by default (dragons are cool, but a book with dragons is not always inherently queer) and also thinks that ""queen"" is an adequate replacement for the word ""queer.""

I have shared this unfortunate news with other language educators who are all equally saddened and disheartened by the news. Yes, your representative let me know that there are still Spanish-language books on the website, but this decreases accessibility, visibility, and even the variety of available Spanish-language books.
