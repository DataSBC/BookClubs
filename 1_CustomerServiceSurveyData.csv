I called and spoke with Abrianne Murphy and after research, she noticed that our order had been sitting in your warehouse for 2 weeks awaiting for us to set up transportation with DHL (which no one told us about nor have we ever had to do this)  I then requested that she just cancel the order because we do not have the time now to distribute the books to the students before school ends next week. Then all of the sudden, yesterday afternoon we received the order. We can not accept this order as we requested it to be cancelled and it has already been cancelled on our end.

Not one other company I've ever done business with, and there's been thousands over the years, has ever charged me twice! By doing this,  your company has held up an extra $28.89 of money that does not belong to you and was most certainly not authorized by me,  making it a fraudulent charge by your company! So then I had to go through the process of filing a claim through my bank and they also found it to be fraudulent and returned my money immediately. Imagine if every business did business this way??? None of us would have a dime to our name!! I will not be doing business with your company again, nor will any of my family and friends and I will certainly be spreading the word about your companies unethical business practices starting with the BBB.

Unfortunately it was unavailable, so you subbed an activity book for it. I’m seriously disappointed for a couple reasons - 1) the book I choose was a journal with a pen for a girl, it was replaced with a 4 page activity book clearly for boys and cheap looking 2) an option of substitution should have been given OR given the other book that was $3 and also on the list discounted to free.

5/11/23 13:29,464086320643,Parent/Family Member,2," It's 2023! Computer do what programs (PEOPLE) tell them to do. Your system keeps sending me an invoice that has a NEGATIVE balance, so you owe me a credit, that looks like a bill and the text of the email only mentions how to PAY the invoice! I had to find the small print at the bottom of invoice talking about how to get or use a credit, which required me to call for you to send me money? Then your customer service people can't even see my account info other than my name and that I have a NEGATIVE balance and then I am told it will be reviewed and I had to supply my address IF I get sent a refund check....this from an order from Jan 2022!!! I thought this was done! All that aside, it is ridiculous that in 2023, you have not set up a system to take care of this WITHOUT requiring your customers to REQUEST a refund or sending passive aggressive emails that look like a bill when it is not a bill with no way to replay back to the email. Your phone system had ridiculous number of options NONE of which help a PARENT get to someone for the purposes of requesting this refund! The entire process was ridiculous! I am sorry if your ""customer service rep"" (who couldn't see anything she needed to actually help me, so worst customer service ever, but not her fault, it is your company's fault for having such a backwards, outdated system! I could tell she was a bit shocked that I was so upset, but I was FRUSTRATED that your company has drug this out over a year and still keep acting like I am the one who screwed up! All I did was place an order, that got misdelivered like 3 times because your system couldn't figure out how to  update the school's shipping address. I am not even sure if me or the school ever got the books. As of last September, I did not care anymore since I was supposed to have gotten a refund already! So please do not give your customer service rep a hard time. Get with the technology and figure out how to do this better! Your company been around since at least when I was in grade school over 40 yrs ago, sorry but that is no excuse to have such a convoluted system in 2023!

It has to do with serious systemic issues within the company. You can resolve it by publishing books that engage with race and injustice in meaningful ways and don't force authors to choose between working with you and being ""whitewashed."" Similarly, my nephew and his classmates enjoy your books, but I will look elsewhere if I can't get books that seriously engage important issues facing society. Those of us who believe racism is a problem that needs to be addressed buy books too.  Here is my earlier note:   I often buy books for my nephew and his classroom. Given the recent revelations about Scholastic's attempts to “dumb down” books addressing racism and other systemic forms of inequality, I am very concerned about continuing to support Scholastic. I will certainly be looking into other options and may purchase other books addressing race and racism for his classroom, rather than spending money on scholastic books.    I hope you will takes seriously the responsibilities that come with your position and stand up to the bullies who want to “whiten” our educational system. They do all of us a disservice.

I had a parent order cancelled long before our order due date because the ""system"" thought we would be out of school before it was ordered. Then the class order was submitted after that and the parent had to resubmit the order and have it shipped to home.

5/10/23 8:41,463989754901,Teacher/Educator,1," I contacted Scholastic to change the delivery address, as I received an email that my order was being returned to the Sender. I was told that I would need to place the order again and then wait for my first purchase to be credited back to me. I didn't think it was a big deal to change a delivery address, but apparently it can't be done. As a teacher, I can't afford to make multiple orders and wait for my money to possibly be refunded. I asked that the order be cancelled and am still awaiting my credit. I will likely end up spending twice as much and ordering the books from Amazon, as I have done in the past when Scholastic failed to deliver my books on time. It will cost a small fortune, but I would like my students to have an end of the school year book. Scholastic doesn't appear to be able to deliver on their promises and has been a disappointment once again. I will be seeking other book clubs for my students and will be advising colleagues of the same. Amazon may be more expensive, but at least I know that the books will be delivered on time.

I started a chat to ask why two of my online student orders were submitted automatically without my knowledge. I had orders to add to the two online orders and had wanted to add some things on my own for my classroom and use up some bonus points. The order was just a few dollars away from the next level of bonus points, too. I am very frustrated with this process and not knowing it was going to happen. If I knew I would have added everything in to get the most out of the order. I was told that I could contact Scholastic once a new order is placed and combine it and get reimbursed for orders under $25 if applicable. This is a lot more work than necessary and just adds more to do from a teacher's end. The process used to be smooth and easy and now it is not. I had been a loyal customer for almost 20 years. I took a year off because after COVID it was a nightmare to order and process with Scholastic. Books took forever to come and many orders were incorrect. Some books never came and it was time consuming to rectify everything that went wrong. I missed the excitement of my students getting books, however, and several colleagues said things had gotten better, so I decided to give it try with this current class. Everything was great until this current order. Unfortunately, I will not continue to order if the automatic submissions cannot be turned off. I don't have the extra time to contact Scholastic to merge multiple orders or to get reimbursement if needed. There were many more ""perks"" in the past and the ease of online ordering and being able to add student and personal orders before submitting was awesome.",Unhappy Auto-Submit,Unhappy Auto-Submit,Email Post Chat CSAT Survey,,,,CARRIE DUNBAR,cdunbar@uscsd.k12.pa.us,5/2/2023
