I had money left in the e-wallet when I ordered an item on sale. I was going to have the item shipped to my son’s school to avoid shipping charges. When I contacted customer service last week, I was told that my order had expired because my son’s teacher had not submitted the order. He had not been notified that I had ordered anything, and he had submitted an order later in February but my order must have already expired because he did not see it. I was frustrated with scholastic for this whole process. The money from the e-wallet disappeared after the order I placed in February, and I did not get that credit back when my order was cancelled. So instead of paying $11.56 for the order like I would have done in February, I ended up paying over $21 due to shipping and not being given the sale price. Instead I was given a coupon code for a free $5 book and told that I would be refunded my shipping once I receive the order. It just seems like a headache and a lot of hoops to jump through when someone maybe could have just given me $10 off in the beginning rather than giving me an extra book that I didn’t really want.

I started a chat to ask why two of my online student orders were submitted automatically without my knowledge. I had orders to add to the two online orders and had wanted to add some things on my own for my classroom and use up some bonus points. The order was just a few dollars away from the next level of bonus points, too. I am very frustrated with this process and not knowing it was going to happen. If I knew I would have added everything in to get the most out of the order. I was told that I could contact Scholastic once a new order is placed and combine it and get reimbursed for orders under $25 if applicable. This is a lot more work than necessary and just adds more to do from a teacher's end. The process used to be smooth and easy and now it is not. I had been a loyal customer for almost 20 years. I took a year off because after COVID it was a nightmare to order and process with Scholastic. Books took forever to come and many orders were incorrect. Some books never came and it was time consuming to rectify everything that went wrong. I missed the excitement of my students getting books, however, and several colleagues said things had gotten better, so I decided to give it try with this current class. Everything was great until this current order. Unfortunately, I will not continue to order if the automatic submissions cannot be turned off. I don't have the extra time to contact Scholastic to merge multiple orders or to get reimbursement if needed. There were many more ""perks"" in the past and the ease of online ordering and being able to add student and personal orders before submitting was awesome.",Auto-Submit Concern,Auto-Submit Concern,Email Post Chat CSAT Survey,,,,CARRIE DUNBAR,cdunbar@uscsd.k12.pa.us,5/2/2023

The auto-submit that happened is frustrating, as I planned to add to the order myself, I get points for the total order submitted, I have a coupon code for points, and I wanted to spend points with this last order of the school year. Now, I have lost the opportunity to increase my points based on order dollar amount, as well as the above stated issues. The representative I chatted with briefly just said this was to make it easier for teachers and I could call or email someone once the other family orders are in and I submit them, but this does not make it easier for me.

4/25/2023 14:02,463190585626,Teacher/Educator,1, I am very upset with the direction Scholastic seems to be going in.  You no longer offer 1.00 books like we used to have access to.  Teachers would use these one dollar books to give as gifts to their students at Christmas and the end of the year.  Now they are few and far between which is very disappointing.  You have raised them 100% ...to 2 dollars.  ALSO ... I just placed a 123.00 order in April.  I see that I will no longer get my 10.00 of free books this month like in the past...now you give a coupon for 10.oo for a May order.  I am not getting book orders every single month!!  Are you guys really that clueless on how the economy is going right now.  Teachers are not sending book orders home every month because we know that would be tone deaf with the way people are struggling financially lately.  Since I will not ask parents to spend more money in MAY after they just spent 123.00 in April....that basically means my 10.00 that I earned this month will not be used!!!   You all know that....which is why you did it.  You are saving yourselves the money that we earned.   I am very disappointed in the direction Scholastic is going.

Then the next day, again they weren't available.  It was a bit frustrating as I was trying to complete and send in my order.  I haven't experienced any issues like that before.  When I called and spoke to your representative, she said that the Click Clack Picture Book Pack was out of stock.  She did give me a code number to receive $5 coupon to use later.
