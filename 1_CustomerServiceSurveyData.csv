"Monday, March 27, 2023",461596745039,Other,2," Scholastic has too many divisions.  I understand that is how you need to keep things organized on your end, but on ours, it causes confusion to the point some will choose to use a different vendor.  I am the Purchasing Coordinator and tried to make it easy by talking with my reps and labeling each vendor by, club, fair, magazine, teacher resource and yet....this time, there was another entitiy that did not fit the criteria of the four I already had in the system.  You also have serveral different PO Boxes....however, I have been told that no matter where I send it, you will get it to the correct department.  Then why can we not just send the invoice to one PO Box?",LOB Confusion,LOB Confusion,Email Post Email CSAT Survey,,,,first name last name,cathy.holman@isd709.org,3/22/2023
"Friday, March 24, 2023",461720899254,Other,1," I am a retired guy with excess personal means who is currently sponsoring teachers' classroom wish lists at two elementary schools. These are items which are outside of their allotted budgets. You are the ONLY site I've ever encountered which has stone-walled my attempts to buy classroom materials. Do you need the two schools in question to vouch for my donor history in order to allow me to direct purchase from the site that teachers and parents use? Being referred to your store.scholastic.com site is a worthless exercise since the titles requested by teachers have so far not generally been available on that site. I understand the discounts offered by the book publishers may have created contractual obligations for selling to schools or parents only. But surely, if I can be vouched for by Lowell Elementary School (Duluth, MN) and Northern Lights Elementary School (Superior, WI) - you ought to be able to allow me to create an account which I expect will generate in total a four figure sum in book orders over the indefinite span of time I intend to do this gifting. Can we figure out a way to make it easier for you to sell more books and still remain within the framework of whatever contracts you're obliged to honor ?

I was not notified about that change either. If you are going to make changes, you should notify your teachers. I am afraid to send flyers home now for fear that I will not get $25.00 or more and I will have to pay $6.50.

The individual I spoke with informed me that the cut off date to order the book and receive it on the release date was March 20th. Then she noted that my student had placed the order online on March 20th, but that the book order was not processed until the release date of March 28th. That didn't really make sense to me if he ordered within the deadline, but she couldn't provide any other answers. So I used the Live Chat online and they told me that the cut off date for ordering was actually March 19th. So my student had missed the cut off date, which would explain way he hadn't received the book yet. Not a big deal, we were happy to figure out why the book hadn't arrived yet.",Low Inventory or Variety,Out of Stock,Email Post Chat CSAT Survey,,,,CHRISTINE GROBERT,cgrobert@chatham-nj.org,3/31/2023

How can I change my profile to reflect that while still receiving kindergarten material for my above-level students? This survey assumes that my situation was resolved.

"Thursday, March 23, 2023",461657823084,Teacher/Educator,1, I tried to make a phone call to have the order changed for the parent that ordered online but the phone number is not readily availabale.  I did a live chat in the afternoon to try and resolve the problem but I was told that the order was in the process of being filled so changes could not happen.  I was told that the parent can return the item at their cost and get a refund or exchange it for a different item.  The problem with this is parents are not going to want to order if problems can't be fixed before the order is completed or shipped.  I was not pleased with how difficult it was to deal with you in a timely manner.  If things go well they are great but not so much when there is a problem.,High Prices & Fees,Shipping Fee,Email Post Chat CSAT Survey,,,,SANDRA AHLSKOG,sandra_j_ahlskog@mcpsmd.org,3/22/2023

It would be very beneficial if this could be done at the point of the initial order.  There are different people in different departments that have to be involved in the current method and it could be a quicker easier process.,Account Balance & Payment,Tax,Email Post Call CSAT Survey,,5,4,KIM FISHER,fisherk@usd290.org,3/20/2023
