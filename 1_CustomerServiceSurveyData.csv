Many of the parents do not have access to the internet or a phone, do not have a debit card or credit card.  Since you want the orders done and paid for on line, it takes away from the students who can buy books this year.  I think your changes aren't great for schools who have low socio economic families.  This works great for middle and upper class families but not the population I serve at my school.  Your changes have made me question whether or not I will order this year because of the changes.

In many cases, our students cannot afford to purchase books to keep at home, nor do they have access to wonderful opportunities like the public library, to no fault of their own. My students loved getting a book per month and I was okay with spending $25 each month to help my class. However, the expense went from $250 per year, to $500 per year. That is quite a jump for teachers. Unfortunately, this change means that my students will only receive five books instead of the ten my previous classes have had. I just want teachers and students to have access to good books and I feel that providing those $1 books was such a fantastic way to provide such opportunities.

The teacher would have to figure out the tax and how much a parent would owe in order to aloow a parent to send in a check. I'm in a district where a lot of my kids are being raised by grandparents that don't have Smartphones and the internet. So, while I understand the less paper products going out, I think it's wrong to put all the pressure on the teacher to be obligated to do all those extra steps in order to provide equality in ordering opportunity to each family. They should be still be given an option, or at the least, tax should be figured out on the flyer to make it easier on the teachers. I place large amount orders every month we are in school and it's a pain but I'm the only one that does it. The kids love it amd it's a shame I won't be able to do it this year.

8/23/2023 9:22,4.69407E+11,Teacher/Educator,1," I have been a teacher for 25 years.  I have always used Scholastic Book Clubs and for many years now, Scholastic Weekly Readers.  I am frustrated because it feels like it is getting harder and harder to get books at reasonable prices (meaning for less than you can get them elsewhere).  It is also getting harder and harder to use bonus points.  And...harder and harder to get free shipping.  There has been a significant decrease in the number of parents ordering over the past few years, despite sending home the flyers and encouraging families to order each month.  They tell me the prices aren't much better(if at all) than they can get elsewhere, so they don't bother.    Yesterday, I was looking for a book to give to my students when they meet me at Kindergarten Orientation.  I typically use bonus points earned from the previous year to place the order.  The less expensive book options in Book Clubs were not really appropriate for a Welcome to Kindergarten day.  I received an email from Scholastic, encouraging me to look at 25% off books.  That email directed me to the Teacher Store.  I immediately found a perfect book (Kindergarten, Here I Come).  I tried using bonus points, but it wasn't an option.  I reached out to Scholastic and found out that Bonus points can only be used in the Book Club.  So I went to the book club, but that particular book isn't available (something tells me that is deliberate).  Despite my frustration, I decided to return to the teacher store and just pay the price (without bonus points), but then when I tried to check out, there was a $9 shipping charge (I typically get free shipping over $25 - this was a $50 purchase, so I figured it would apply).  I reached out to Scholastic.  Apparently, I can only use free shipping in the Book Club (I can only assume that is deliberate as well).    I started looking around.  I decided to delete my order and order the books from Amazon instead!  The book was slightly more expensive there, but with Amazon's free shipping, it was basically the same (and guaranteed delivery next day, which Scholastic delivery time has been less reliable in recent years).  I am really sad to be moving further and further away from Scholastic.  I wish that a nearly 25-year relationship with Scholastic would be rewarding, but it truly isn't.  It is only rewarding under very strict terms that do not serve the purpose or desires of the customer (a HUGE change from years past).  I am very disappointed that Scholastic expects teachers to pay nearly $60 (book price, tax and shipping) to put ONE book in the hand of 16 students.  It makes me question my desire to continue my relationship with Scholastic.",High Prices,High Prices,Email Post Chat CSAT Survey,,,,HEATHER MEIVES,hmeives@nscsd.org,8/22/2023

I was told that the date is now determined by the state you teach in, and it is unchangeable. I also don't remember receiving prior notice of this, although I admit that I might not have read an update memo. Because the due date is so far away, I did not send out the flyer/notice yet that I normally would have. Additionally, when I printed out the parent letter to include in our classroom information packet, I was no longer able to find it in Spanish. Either I didn't know where to look, or that is a very culturally insensitive oversight on the part of Scholastic.

Now I have to click on the shopping cart and log in to the teacher site (it takes me about 5 minutes to remember how to do this every time...especially after the summer break from school). From a teacher's perspective, Scholastic is in a much weaker place than they were prior to COVID. Rewards for teachers are way down. i.e. the first flyers were always the best as they offered substantial rewards up to $20 in free books and lots of bonus points. (usually was 10,000) This year's was limited to $10 and minimal points. I've also experienced a huge decline in number of students ordering. Prior to COVID I'd reach $300+ each 1st order of the school year. The last three years I've only reached around $50. I fear its that the catalogues are getting smaller and redundant. Variety in titles (and not simply recycling through the same books order after order) is almost nonexistent any more. Every book order is virtually the same.

8/20/2023 19:26,4.69149E+11,Teacher/Educator,1," Your customer service rep completely missed my point in that your delivery service is not living up to expectations set by you.  You have kids looking for the book box.  You even send emails that the book box will be delivered tomorrow.  Then UPS says they couldn't deliver because it was a holiday and the business was closed - it was a blatant lie, the school was open, 50+ cars in the parking lot, office personnel present the entire day, and it was NOT a holiday.   But your customer service rep said they still have a time frame to deliver.  Don't send emails for the kids to anticipate a service if you have no intention of follow through.  This is not the first time this has happened.  It is very disappointing.  I have urged parents to order from Amazon for direct home delivery",CS Experience,CS Experience,Email Post Email CSAT Survey,,,,TAYA CLINE,taya.cline@k12.wv.us,8/17/2023

Apparently that is no longer an option and I wish it was. I would like to have the option to be able to set my own deadline.  i know the agent said I could submit the order in earlier if I want but if the parents see a deadline a month away, that could cause confusion when in class I say the deadline is one week away.",Due Date,Due Date,Email Post Chat CSAT Survey,,,,ROBIN SNYDER,rsnyder@conroeisd.net,8/18/2023

I like to give my students a book each month but I may not be able to without the value packs and books being $3.00 each.

The disappointment was, in changing how you do book orders, you got rid of Club Leo, and your selection of books in spanish is Not Good. I wanted to get a pack of picture books as I have done in the past to be able to send books home with my spanish speaking students and families. The only thing you had was a set of board books. I am so disappointed in this. I might cancel my scholastic account all together and just go to Amazon.
