I was unable to use the phone while I'm in a classroom with children. I also didn't want two or three different orders. Emailed once about $10 coupon. Was told to email back a second time to get coupon code for free book. I did that and Instead of receiving the code, I was directed to contact customer service and request my free books over the phone. I was placing an online order today and had already emailed twice. Can't use the phone while I'm in the classroom with children. Ended up placing my order without the coupon code so that I could complete my order today.

You changed some of his language which someone deemed to be problematic. Editing an author's work without his or her knowledge is not okay. I don't care what you think your reasons for doing it are. There is no excuse for tampering with someone's creative work. It is unethical and immoral. I hope you will reconsider this practice and cease immediately.",Other,Other,Email Post Email CSAT Survey,,,,first name last name,carol.kennedy@comcast.net,3/9/2023
