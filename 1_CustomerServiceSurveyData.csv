I believe for the last 10 years the first reward/bonus of the year was 10,000 points for classroom orders of over $300.  I have hit this mark for a number of years now, but this year if my class orders 300 dollars worth of books, I get an extra 1,000 points and X5 my order total???  That adds up to 2,500 points which is 1/4 of what it used to be.  You all (Scholastic) still get your money and teachers are getting the short end of the stick.  You should probably rethink this for the future.  I have told countless teachers for years about the beginning of the year bonus and many of my colleges have joined and pushed Scholastic.

8/14/2023 12:12,4.68922E+11,Teacher/Educator,2, I do not think that it is okay for teacher's to not be able to set the order due date. I do not want the date that has arbitrarily been put into the account. I want all orders to be placed collectively for the free shipping. How will that work if I have already placed the order and then another parent places one?,Due Date,Due Date,Email Post Chat CSAT Survey,,,,Lisa Hoverson,hoverson.lisa@cusd80.com,8/14/2023

But, I told the person that I was so disappointed at the new rewards for teachers.  Not as many as before.  And your prices have gone up.  I looked at our favorite class book this year, and it's $8...It's $7 on Amazon.  I had always thought Scholastic was an economical way to build a home library for kids, but it seems like you are getting more and more expensive. That's sad.  I won't be able to promote you as well as before to parents because things are more.  There's no dollar weekly deals and it seems your packs have gone up as well.  Last year I could get 10 for $10 and hope to see that come back.  As well as the $1 weekly book.  Or $1 deals in the flyers.  As well as the bonus points for teachers to go back to what they were before too.  That's what made it worth my time as a teacher.  There's so much we're doing, and I have to spend time on what gives the greatest rewards. Thanks for your consideration.
