You must now collaborate with independent writers, embracing fresh perspectives and ideas. This is not a threat to tradition; instead, it's an invitation to innovate and adapt. We must recognize that today's children will soon inherit the world we leave behind. It's imperative we prepare them for the unexpected twists and turns that lie ahead, equipping them with the knowledge and adaptability they'll need. We should not fear change but embrace it. By accepting and adapting to changes sooner rather than later, we ensure a smoother transition for everyone involved. The fabric of our future is being woven today, and we must ensure our children are ready to uphold the balance in the ever-evolving landscape. Thank you for being a part of this journey.

Prior to this, the teacher handed out the flyer, you made your choices, wrote out a check, and sent the order with your check back to the teacher. I liked the idea of the app, because I don’t have to worry about lost orders, money, or checks.   However, I found your app difficult to navigate if you are not technically inclined. When you enter the grade level, it would be beneficial if the latest flyer came up. It took me quite a while to find it, and I am technically savvy.

At this point we still haven't received our September fliers and we are halfway through September.  I also haven't yet received my Scholastic Big World booklets for September.  I received October but not September.  The first person I spoke with said I should receive our book order fliers last Thursday (September 14) by noon.  Friday we still hadn't received them so I called again and they said I should get them but in case they would mail out a second set.  If that takes 7-10 business days we won't get them until September 26+/- and by then we are almost at the end of the month.

Customer Service was great in helping me find out this information, but it is sad news. My class loves having a new book every month from my fundraising. It is unfortunate because we will not longer be able to afford book of the month at $2 per book as I cannot get enough money from friends and family to get a book for each of my 25 students every month. I am hoping for scholastic to bring back book of the week for $1 next year. I wasn't aware of the change until now and will have to pay out of my own pocket for half of the cost for each set of books for my class every month in order to keep my promise to them. Without the $1 books I will no longer be able to do this amazing program I have done for years and giving a home library to students.",Prices & Fees,Dollar Books,Email Post Chat CSAT Survey,,,,CARLA PIMIENTA,carla.pimienta@woodbridge.k12.nj.us,9/19/2023

Also, all the prices have gone up quite a bit.  Unfortunately, we understand this is a nation wide issue, but this year's donations we sought are not going to cover the new expenses.  Last year the books we purchased were around $2.00 a book.  This year we cannot find things for our Kindergarteners that are less than $4.00 a book.

The response was both was the copy and pasted response of parents can look for me on the site.  I am from an low income school where a lot of them may not have access to good, if any internet.  Finally I was explained that you no longer give codes.  I truly do not like this, as I feel like it will distance parents from actually wanting to take the time to search for me which in turn will lower the chance of books being purchased.  Many of these parents do not know how to read, are not interested in reading, don't want to/have the time, to search for me.  Some probably do not even know my name. I do not like the way this is now set up.",Connect Teacher,Connect Teacher,Email Post Chat CSAT Survey,,,,Kate Trace,catherin.trace@janesville.k12.wi.us,9/14/2023

Removing the paper order form also deletes a good % of families to order. ",SFO,SFO,Email Post Email CSAT Survey,,,,Renee Watson,rwatson@hawthorne.k12.ca.us,9/11/2023

9/14/2023 13:42,4.70556E+11,Teacher/Educator,3,I contacted support for not being able to change my due date for my class. The person told me she is not able to change that and that is that across the board. I would like to change my due date bc I like to send my flyers out at certain parts of the month. I went to send mine home yesterday (middle of the month) but It was saying that the parents had to place their order by the 13th which was yesterday. The representative said that she couldn't change it and that yall did this to help teachers out. That is not the case. Not being in control of our own due date is frustrating. I didn't even get to send mine home at all and just trashed them because the due date was off for the parents and she said that they can place it whenever but wouldn't be send out until October something. How frustrating. They also asked if I just got my flyers in if that was why I didn't send them home yet. I informed them that I don't send home in the first few weeks of school because the start of school is expensive and hard on parents. I have been doing scholastic for 10+ plus years. (I didn't last year because I was out on maternity leave) So all of this to say Please let teachers be in charge of their own due dates again!

One suggestion was to create my own form for parents to be able to fill out and keep track of who ordered what so families who do not have access to online payments or internet can order.  This creates more work.  The set due date is also frustrating because it is very confusing to have different from what it is from the classroom.  Again, the feedback was not really listened to.  I usually love customer service from Scholastic, and have spoken very highly of them in the past to others.  This time you are missing the mark.  I hope you are receiving other feedback from teachers, because this is what I am seeing all over social media right now. See previous comment.
