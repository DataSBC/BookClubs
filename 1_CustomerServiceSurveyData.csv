4/18/2023 14:11,462893588434,Other,1, Our school has been trying to order books that was from our fall book fair and we have submitted PO and list of books several times and no one seems to know anything about this.  I rec'd an email today that I should send a list with item numbers and the teacher ID# which it is being ordered from the school office of which I have the list of books and prices but no Item #.  Just frustrating that we can't get any answers and where are the emails with the PO's going to if noone can seem to find them?

I contacted because I was ordering specific books, out of my pocket, for my students for their end of year gifts. I have ordered Weird School books quite a few times. Sometimes 25+ of the same title and have never had a issue with being able to use the bonus points no matter what book or price point. Speaking for myself, I spend a good bit of money of my own for my students and the bonus points help balance that out some. I know I don't order a lot, but feel less likely to encourage parents to order knowing that I will be limited as to what I can use them on. I understand that there are many others that I could use the points on, but I don't feel like it is beneficial for those whom it is supposed to aid.",Rewards & Promos,Rewards & Promos,Email Post Chat CSAT Survey,,,,Melissa Scercy,melissa.scercy@yorkprepsc.org,4/12/2023

We are involved in a double charge to our school credit card right now (it's not showing as a credit balance on my account, so I don't know where the funds are), but it was charged twice to our school credit card.

I asked if there was anyone who could help. You clearly still sell the books, I know that could be accommodated. I even said I understand pricing would be changed due to the expiration of the ""deal"". The person who responded to my emails didn't answer those questions for help or for a manager or anything. Simply here is a similar option which I did appreciate as a last resort. He or she wouldn't even check to see. Perhaps that is your policy - to be firm on the expiration of deals, but he never stated that either. I really need those same exact books for a district wide reading initiative but he only offered another pack with half of the amount of books for nearly the same price. That is fine as well for some of it, but I needed the other six and he offered no way for me to order them. It was discouraging is all. He was professional, but short in responses and didn't even answer many of the questions at all. The responses were matter of fact and offered no further assistance. See previous description for full details. I am needed a pack of books that I'm told is no longer available. I understand that deals expire. I could even get them for a different price if needed. I just needed 15 of this one book pack of Biscuit books. It was 12 books in shrink wrap. I am sure they still print those books even if individually and he offered a six pack only.

The delete button is not there, so I cannot get rid of it, nor can I use the bonus points that it is currently ""using"" for that item. The bonus points are still being docked. A total of 825 points. She said it may be a few business days, and it has been 2, I believe. No movement has been made on my account, but it hasn't been the full time she said it would take yet, so that's fine. As far as the chat itself, there was minimal customer service etiquette. She wasn't rude, but she was not exactly thorough in her responses, and she left me hanging for a while.

Almost every month I have to call or email and remind Scholastic to send the paper flyers.  Each time they say they have made the adjustments and the next month they should come without issue and they don't.  This most recent time I emailed and was told that the account is not in my name that it is in the name of a former employee, Diana Adams.  Before she left, she told me she changed the account into my name and I had been receiving flyers in my name.  This time I was told the account is still in her name and that it can't be changed to my name I'd have to make a new account.  I just don't have time for this, so if it can't be resolved we will on linger be offering Scholastic books to our parents.

We accumulate points based on the cash amount our parents spend with their orders. Many times we use our points to buy books as gifts for our children. Charging a shipping fee is outrageous when our parents have already paid the books and shipping through their initial orders.  Scholastic may no longer by the ""Go to"" for books when they can be purchased quicker through Amazon with free shipping.
