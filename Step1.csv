There used to be a $1 book each month. Then those were phased out, and the $1 book of the week was fine usually. It was also nice to have the 5-book packs and the 10-book packs for $5 and $10 respectively.  I typically spend enough at Scholastic that I was also able to shop the $1 book store after spending the required amount. Through all of these ways, I have been able to  provide my students with a brand new book each month.      This year, I will not be able to do it. I have raised $300, but there are no $1 or equivalent book offers. Prices on the books are the same as Amazon, if not higher.
